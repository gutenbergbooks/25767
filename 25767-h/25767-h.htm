      NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two of the following papers were originally published, with illustrations,
      in Harper&rsquo;s Magazine and the title of one of them&mdash;the first of
      titles has been altered from &ldquo;Our Artists in Europe.&rdquo; The other, the
      article on Mr. Sargent, was accompanied by reproductions of several of his
      portraits. The notice of Mr. Abbey and that of Mr. Reinhart appeared in
      Harper&rsquo;s Weekly. That of Mr. Alfred Parsons figured as an introduction to
      the catalogue of an exhibition of his pictures. The sketch of Daumier was
      first contributed to <i>The Century</i>, and &ldquo;After the Play&rdquo; to <i>The
      New Review</i>.

      If there be nothing new under the sun there are some things a good deal
      less old than others. The illustration of books, and even more of
      magazines, may be said to have been born in our time, so far as variety
      and abundance are the signs of it; or born, at any rate, the
      comprehensive, ingenious, sympathetic spirit in which we conceive and
      practise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the centuries are ever arraigned at some bar of justice to answer in
      regard to what they have given, of good or of bad, to humanity, our
      interesting age (which certainly is not open to the charge of having stood
      with its hands in its pockets) might perhaps do worse than put forth the
      plea of having contributed a fresh interest in &ldquo;black and white.&rdquo; The
      claim may now be made with the more confidence from the very evident
      circumstance that this interest is far from exhausted. These pages are an
      excellent place for such an assumption. In Harper they have again and
      again, as it were, illustrated the illustration, and they constitute for
      the artist a series of invitations, provocations and opportunities. They
      may be referred to without arrogance in support of the contention that the
      limits of this large movement, with all its new and rare refinement, are
      not yet in sight.

      It is on the contrary the constant extension that is visible, with the
      attendant circumstances of multiplied experiment and intensified research&mdash;circumstances
      that lately pressed once more on the attention of the writer of these
      remarks on his finding himself in the particular spot which history will
      perhaps associate most with the charming revival. A very old English
      village, lying among its meadows and hedges, in the very heart of the
      country, in a hollow of the green hills of Worcestershire, is responsible
      directly and indirectly for some of the most beautiful work in black and
      white with which I am at liberty to concern myself here; in other words,
      for much of the work of Mr. Abbey and Mr. Alfred Parsons. I do not mean
      that Broadway has told these gentlemen all they know (the name, from which
      the American reader has to brush away an incongruous association, may as
      well be written first as last); for Mr. Parsons, in particular, who knows
      everything that can be known about English fields and flowers, would have
      good reason to insist that the measure of his large landscape art is a
      large experience. I only suggest that if one loves Broadway and is
      familiar with it, and if a part of that predilection is that one has seen
      Mr. Abbey and Mr. Parsons at work there, the pleasant confusion takes
      place of itself; one&rsquo;s affection for the wide, long, grass-bordered vista
      of brownish gray cottages, thatched, latticed, mottled, mended, ivied,
      immemorial, grows with the sense of its having ministered to other minds
      and transferred itself to other recipients; just as the beauty of many a
      bit in many a drawing of the artists I have mentioned is enhanced by the
      sense, or at any rate by the desire, of recognition. Broadway and much of
      the land about it are in short the perfection of the old English rural
      tradition, and if they do not underlie all the combinations by which (in
      their pictorial accompaniments to rediscovered ballads, their vignettes to
      story or sonnet) these particular talents touch us almost to tears, we
      feel at least that they <i>would</i> have sufficed: they cover the scale.

      In regard, however, to the implications and explications of this
      perfection of a village, primarily and to be just, Broadway is, more than
      any one else. Mr. Frank Millet. Mr. Laurence Hutton discovered but Mr.
      Millet appropriated it: its sweetness was wasted until he began to distil
      and bottle it. He disinterred the treasure, and with impetuous liberality
      made us sharers in his fortune. His own work, moreover, betrays him, as
      well as the gratitude of participants, as I could easily prove if it did
      not perversely happen that he has commemorated most of his impressions in
      color. That excludes them from the small space here at my command;
      otherwise I could testify to the identity of old nooks and old objects,
      those that constitute both out-of-door and in-door furniture.

      In such places as Broadway, and it is part of the charm of them to
      American eyes, the sky looks down on almost as many &ldquo;things&rdquo; as the
      ceiling, and &ldquo;things&rdquo; are the joy of the illustrator. Furnished apartments
      are useful to the artist, but a furnished country is still more to his
      purpose. A ripe midland English region is a museum of accessories and
      specimens, and is sure, under any circumstances, to contain the article
      wanted. This is the great recommendation of Broadway; everything in it is
      convertible. Even the passing visitor finds himself becoming so; the place
      has so much character that it rubs off on him, and if in an old garden&mdash;an
      old garden with old gates and old walls and old summer-houses&mdash;he
      lies down on the old grass (on an immemorial rug, no doubt), it is ten to
      one but that he will be converted. The little oblong sheaves of blank
      paper with elastic straps are fluttering all over the place. There is
      portraiture in the air and composition in the very accidents. Everything
      is a subject or an effect, a &ldquo;bit&rdquo; or a good thing. It is always some kind
      of day; if it be not one kind it is another. The garden walls, the mossy
      roofs, the open doorways and brown interiors, the old-fashioned flowers,
      the bushes in figures, the geese on the green, the patches, the jumbles,
      the glimpses, the color, the surface, the general complexion of things,
      have all a value, a reference and an application. If they are a matter of
      appreciation, that is why the gray-brown houses are perhaps more brown
      than gray, and more yellow than either. They are various things in turn,
      according to lights and days and needs. It is a question of color (all
      consciousness at Broadway is that), but the irresponsible profane are not
      called upon to settle the tint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is delicious to be at Broadway and to <i>be</i> one of the
      irresponsible profane&mdash;not to have to draw. The single street is in
      the grand style, sloping slowly upward to the base of the hills for a
      mile, but you may enjoy it without a carking care as to how to &ldquo;render&rdquo;
       the perspective. Everything is stone except the general greenness&mdash;a
      charming smooth local stone, which looks as if it had been meant for great
      constructions and appears even in dry weather to have been washed and
      varnished by the rain. Half-way up the road, in the widest place, where
      the coaches used to turn (there were many of old, but the traffic of
      Broadway was blown to pieces by steam, though the destroyer has not come
      nearer than half a dozen miles), a great gabled mansion, which was once a
      manor or a house of state, and is now a rambling inn, stands looking at a
      detached swinging sign which is almost as big as itself&mdash;a very grand
      sign, the &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of an old family, on the top of a very tall post. You
      will find something very like the place among Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s delightful
      illustrations to, &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer.&rdquo; When the September day grows
      dim and some of the windows glow, you may look out, if you like, for Tony
      Lumpkin&rsquo;s red coat in the doorway or imagine Miss Hardcastle&rsquo;s quilted
      petticoat on the stair.

      It is characteristic of Mr. Frank Millet&rsquo;s checkered career, with
      opposites so much mingled in it, that such work as he has done for Harper
      should have had as little in common as possible with midland English
      scenery. He has been less a producer in black and white than a promoter
      and, as I may say, a protector of such production in others; but none the
      less the back volumes of Harper testify to the activity of his pencil as
      well as to the variety of his interests. There was a time when he drew
      little else but Cossacks and Orientals, and drew them as one who had good
      cause to be vivid. Of the young generation he was the first to know the
      Russian plastically, especially the Russian soldier, and he had paid
      heavily for his acquaintance. During the Russo-Turkish war he was
      correspondent in the field (with the victors) of the New York <i>Herald</i>
      and the London <i>Daily News</i>&mdash;a capacity in which he made many
      out-of-the-way, many precious, observations. He has seen strange countries&mdash;the
      East and the South and the West and the North&mdash;and practised many
      arts. To the London <i>Graphic</i>, in 1877 he sent striking sketches from
      the East, as well as capital prose to the journals I have mentioned. He
      has always been as capable of writing a text for his own sketches as of
      making sketches for the text of others. He has made pictures without words
      and words without pictures. He has written some very clever ghost-stories,
      and drawn and painted some very immediate realities. He has lately given
      himself up to these latter objects, and discovered that they have
      mysteries more absorbing than any others. I find in Harper, in 1885. &ldquo;A
      Wild-goose Chase&rdquo; through North Germany and Denmark, in which both pencil
      and pen are Mr. Millet&rsquo;s, and both show the natural and the trained
      observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knows the art-schools of the Continent, the studios of Paris, the
      &ldquo;dodges&rdquo; of Antwerp, the subjects, the models of Venice, and has had much
      æsthetic as well as much personal experience. He has draped and
      distributed Greek plays at Harvard, as well as ridden over Balkans to post
      pressing letters, and given publicity to English villages in which
      susceptible Americans may get the strongest sensations with the least
      trouble to themselves. If the trouble in each case will have been largely
      his, this is but congruous with the fact that he has not only found time
      to have a great deal of history himself, but has suffered himself to be
      converted by others into an element&mdash;beneficent I should call it if
      discretion did not forbid me&mdash;of <i>their</i> history. Springing from
      a very old New England stock, he has found the practice of art a wonderful
      antidote, in his own language, &ldquo;for belated Puritanism.&rdquo; He is very
      modern, in the sense of having tried many things and availed himself of
      all of the facilities of his time; but especially on this ground of having
      fought out for himself the battle of the Puritan habit and the æsthetic
      experiment. His experiment was admirably successful from the moment that
      the Puritan levity was forced to consent to its becoming a serious one. In
      other words, if Mr. Millet is artistically interesting to-day (and to the
      author of these remarks he is highly so), it is because he is a striking
      example of what the typical American quality can achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by having an excellent pencil, because as a thoroughly practical
      man he could not possibly have had a weak one. But nothing is more
      remunerative to follow than the stages by which &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; in general
      (which is what I mean by the characteristic American quality) has become
      the particular faculty; so that if in the artist&rsquo;s present work one
      recognizes&mdash;recognizes even fondly&mdash;the national handiness, it
      is as handiness regenerate and transfigured. The American adaptiveness has
      become a Dutch finish. The only criticism I have to make is of the
      preordained paucity of Mr. Millet&rsquo;s drawings; for my mission is not to
      speak of his work in oils, every year more important (as was indicated by
      the brilliant interior with figures that greeted the spectator in so
      friendly a fashion on the threshold of the Royal Academy exhibition of
      1888), nor to say that it is illustration too&mdash;illustration of any
      old-fashioned song or story that hums in the brain or haunts the memory&mdash;nor
      even to hint that the admirable rendering of the charming old objects with
      which it deals (among which I include the human face and figure in dresses
      unfolded from the lavender of the past), the old surfaces and tones, the
      stuffs and textures, the old mahogany and silver and brass&mdash;the old
      sentiment too, and the old picture-making vision&mdash;are in the direct
      tradition of Terburg and De Hoogh and Metzu.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no paucity about Mr. Abbey as a virtuoso in black and white, and
      if one thing more than another sets the seal upon the quality of his work,
      it is the rare abundance in which it is produced. It is not a frequent
      thing to find combinations infinite as well as exquisite. Mr. Abbey has so
      many ideas, and the gates of composition have been opened so wide to him,
      that we cultivate his company with a mixture of confidence and excitement.
      The readers of Harper have had for years a great deal of it, and they will
      easily recognize the feeling I allude to&mdash;the expectation of
      familiarity in variety. The beautiful art and taste, the admirable
      execution, strike the hour with the same note; but the figure, the scene,
      is ever a fresh conception. Never was ripe skill less mechanical, and
      never was the faculty of perpetual evocation less addicted to prudent
      economies. Mr. Abbey never saves for the next picture, yet the next
      picture will be as expensive as the last. His whole career has been open
      to the readers of Harper, so that what they may enjoy on any particular
      occasion is not only the talent, but a kind of affectionate sense of the
      history of the talent, That history is, from the beginning, in these
      pages, and it is one of the most interesting and instructive, just as the
      talent is one of the richest and the most sympathetic in the art-annals of
      our generation. I may as well frankly declare that I have such a taste for
      Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s work that I cannot affect a judicial tone about it. Criticism
      is appreciation or it is nothing, and an intelligence of the matter in
      hand is recorded more substantially in a single positive sign of such
      appreciation than in a volume of sapient objections for objection&rsquo;s sake&mdash;the
      cheapest of all literary commodities. Silence is the perfection of
      disapproval, and it has the great merit of leaving the value of speech,
      when the moment comes for it, unimpaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly it is important to translate as adequately as possible the
      positive side of Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s activity. None to-day is more charming, and
      none helps us more to take the large, joyous, observant, various view of
      the business of art. He has enlarged the idea of illustration, and he
      plays with it in a hundred spontaneous, ingenious ways. &ldquo;Truth and poetry&rdquo;
       is the motto legibly stamped upon his pencil-case, for if he has on the
      one side a singular sense of the familiar, salient, importunate facts of
      life, on the other they reproduce themselves in his mind in a delightfully
      qualifying medium. It is this medium that the fond observer must
      especially envy Mr. Abbey, and that a literary observer will envy him most
      of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a hapless personage, who may have spent hours in trying to produce
      something of the same result by sadly different means, will measure the
      difference between the roundabout, faint descriptive tokens of respectable
      prose and the immediate projection of the figure by the pencil. A charming
      story-teller indeed he would be who should write as Mr. Abbey draws.
      However, what is style for one art is style for other, so blessed is the
      fraternity that binds them together, and the worker in words may take a
      lesson from the picture-maker of &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer.&rdquo; It is true that
      what the verbal artist would like to do would be to find out the secret of
      the pictorial, to drink at the same fountain. Mr. Abbey is essentially one
      of those who would tell us if he could, and conduct us to the magic
      spring; but here he is in the nature of the case helpless, for the happy
      <i>ambiente</i> as the Italians call it, in which his creations move is
      exactly the thing, as I take it, that he can least give an account of. It
      is a matter of genius and imagination&mdash;one of those things that a man
      determines for himself as little as he determines the color of his eyes.
      How, for instance, can Mr. Abbey explain the manner in which he directly
      <i>observes</i> figures, scenes, places, that exist only in the fairy-land
      of his fancy? For the peculiar sign of his talent is surely this
      observation in the remote. It brings the remote near to us, but such a
      complicated journey as it must first have had to make! Remote in time (in
      differing degrees), remote in place, remote in feeling, in habit, and in
      their ambient air, are the images that spring from his pencil, and yet all
      so vividly, so minutely, so consistently seen! Where does he see them,
      where does he find them, how does he catch them, and in what language does
      he delightfully converse with them? In what mystic recesses of space does
      the revelation descend upon him?
    </p>
    <p>
      The questions flow from the beguiled but puzzled admirer, and their tenor
      sufficiently expresses the claim I make for the admirable artist when I
      say that his truth is interfused with poetry. He spurns the literal and
      yet superabounds in the characteristic, and if he makes the strange
      familiar he makes the familiar just strange enough to be distinguished.
      Everything is so human, so humorous and so caught in the act, so buttoned
      and petticoated and gartered, that it might be round the corner; and so it
      is&mdash;but the corner is the corner of another world. In that other
      world Mr. Abbey went forth to dwell in extreme youth, as I need scarcely
      be at pains to remind those who have followed him in Harper. It is not
      important here to give a catalogue of his contributions to that journal:
      turn to the back volumes and you will meet him at every step. Every one
      remembers his young, tentative, prelusive illustrations to Herrick, in
      which there are the prettiest glimpses, guesses and foreknowledge of the
      effects he was to make completely his own. The Herrick was done mainly, if
      I mistake not, before he had been to England, and it remains, in the light
      of this fact, a singularly touching as well as a singularly promising
      performance. The eye of sense in such a case had to be to a rare extent
      the mind&rsquo;s eye, and this convertibility of the two organs has persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first and always that other world and that qualifying medium in
      which I have said that the human spectacle goes on for Mr. Abbey have been
      a county of old England which is not to be found in any geography, though
      it borders, as I have hinted, on the Worcestershire Broadway. Few artistic
      phenomena are more curious than the congenital acquaintance of this
      perverse young Philadelphian with that mysterious locality. It is there
      that he finds them all&mdash;the nooks, the corners, the people, the
      clothes, the arbors and gardens and teahouses, the queer courts of old
      inns, the sun-warmed angles of old parapets. I ought to have mentioned for
      completeness, in addition to his pictures to Goldsmith and to the scraps
      of homely British song (this latter class has contained some of his most
      exquisite work), his delicate drawing&rsquo;s for Mr. William Black&rsquo;s <i>Judith
      Shakespeare</i>. And in relation to that distinguished name&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      mean Mr. Black&rsquo;s&mdash;it is a comfort, if I may be allowed the
      expression, to know that (as, to the best of my belief, I violate no
      confidence in saying) he is even now engaged in the great work of
      illustrating the comedies. He is busy with &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice;&rdquo; he is
      up to his neck in studies, in rehearsals. Here again, while in prevision I
      admire the result, what I can least refrain from expressing is a sort of
      envy of the process, knowing what it is with Mr. Abbey and what
      explorations of the delightful it entails&mdash;arduous, indefatigable,
      till the end seems almost smothered in the means (such material
      complications they engender), but making one&rsquo;s daily task a thing of
      beauty and honor and beneficence.

      Even if Mr. Alfred Parsons were not a masterly contributor to the pages of
      Harper, it would still be almost inevitable to speak of him after speaking
      of Mr. Abbey, for the definite reason (I hope that in giving it I may not
      appear to invade too grossly the domain of private life) that these
      gentlemen are united in domestic circumstance as well as associated in the
      nature of their work. In London, in the relatively lucid air of Campden
      Hill, they dwell together, and their beautiful studios are side by side.
      However, there is a reason for commemorating Mr. Parsons&rsquo; work which has
      nothing to do with the accidental&mdash;the simple fact that that work
      forms the richest illustration of the English landscape that is offered us
      to-day. Harper has for a long time past been full of Mr. Alfred Parsons,
      who has made the dense, fine detail of his native land familiar in far
      countries, amid scenery of a very different type. This is what the modern
      illustration can do when the ripeness of the modern sense is brought to it
      and the wood-cutter plays with difficulties as the brilliant Americans do
      to-day, following his original at a breakneck pace. An illusion is
      produced which, in its very completeness, makes one cast an uneasy eye
      over the dwindling fields that are still left to conquer. Such art as
      Alfred Parsons&rsquo;&mdash;such an accomplished translation of local aspects,
      translated in its turn by cunning hands and diffused by a wonderful system
      of periodicity through vast and remote communities, has, I confess, in a
      peculiar degree, the effect that so many things have in this age of
      multiplication&mdash;that of suppressing intervals and differences and
      making the globe seem alarmingly small. Vivid and repeated evocations of
      English rural things&mdash;the meadows and lanes, the sedgy streams, the
      old orchards and timbered houses, the stout, individual, insular trees,
      the flowers under the hedge and in it and over it, the sweet rich country
      seen from the slope, the bend of the unformidable river, the actual
      romance of the castle against the sky, the place on the hill-side where
      the gray church begins to peep (a peaceful little grassy path leads up to
      it over a stile)&mdash;all this brings about a terrible displacement of
      the very objects that make pilgrimage a passion, and hurries forward that
      ambiguous advantage which I don&rsquo;t envy our grandchildren, that of knowing
      all about everything in advance, having trotted round the globe annually
      in the magazines and lost the bloom of personal experience. It is a part
      of the general abolition of mystery with which we are all so complacently
      busy today. One would like to retire to another planet with a box of Mr.
      Parsons&rsquo; drawings, and be homesick there for the pleasant places they
      commemorate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many things to be said about his talent, some of which are not
      the easiest in the world to express. I shall not, however, make them more
      difficult by attempting to catalogue his contributions in these pages. A
      turning of the leaves of Harper brings one constantly face to face with
      him, and a systematic search speedily makes one intimate. The reader will
      remember the beautiful Illustrations to Mr. Blackmore&rsquo;s novel of <i>Springhaven</i>,
      which were interspersed with striking figure-pieces from the pencil of
      that very peculiar pictorial humorist Mr. Frederick Barnard, who, allowing
      for the fact that he always seems a little too much to be drawing for
      Dickens and that the footlights are the illumination of his scenic world,
      has so remarkable a sense of English types and attitudes, costumes and
      accessories, in what may be called the great-coat-and-gaiters period&mdash;the
      period when people were stiff with riding and wicked conspiracies went
      forward in sanded provincial inn-parlors. Mr. Alfred Parsons, who is still
      conveniently young, waked to his first vision of pleasant material in the
      comprehensive county of Somerset&mdash;a capital centre of impression for
      a painter of the bucolic. He has been to America; he has even reproduced
      with remarkable discrimination and truth some of the way-side objects of
      that country, not making them look in the least like their English
      equivalents, if equivalents they may be said to have. Was it there that
      Mr. Parsons learned so well how Americans would like England to appear? I
      ask this idle question simply because the England of his pencil, and not
      less of his brush (of his eminent brush there would be much to say), is
      exactly the England that the American imagination, restricted to itself,
      constructs from the poets, the novelists, from all the delightful
      testimony it inherits. It was scarcely to have been supposed possible that
      the native point of view would embrace and observe so many of the things
      that the more or less famished outsider is, in vulgar parlance, &ldquo;after.&rdquo;
       In other words (though I appear to utter a foolish paradox), the danger
      might have been that Mr. Parsons knew his subject too well to feel it&mdash;to
      feel it, I mean, <i>à l&rsquo;Américaine</i>. He is as tender of it as if he
      were vague about it, and as certain of it as if he were <i>blasé</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after having wished that his country should be just so, we proceed to
      discover that it is in fact not a bit different. Between these phases of
      our consciousness he is an unfailing messenger. The reader will remember
      how often he has accompanied with pictures the text of some amiable paper
      describing a pastoral region&mdash;Warwickshire or Surrey. Devonshire or
      the Thames. He will remember his exquisite designs for certain of
      Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnets. A sonnet of Wordsworth is a difficult thing to
      illustrate, but Mr. Parsons&rsquo; ripe taste has shown him the way. Then there
      are lovely morsels from his hand associated with the drawings of his
      friend Mr. Abbey&mdash;head-pieces, tailpieces, vignettes, charming
      combinations of flower and foliage, decorative clusters of all sorts of
      pleasant rural emblems. If he has an inexhaustible feeling for the country
      in general, his love of the myriad English flowers is perhaps the fondest
      part of it. He draws them with a rare perfection, and always&mdash;little
      definite, delicate, tremulous things as they are&mdash;with a certain
      nobleness. This latter quality, indeed. I am prone to find in all his
      work, and I should insist on it still more if I might refer to his
      important paintings. So composite are the parts of which any distinguished
      talent is made up that we have to feel our way as we enumerate them; and
      yet that very ambiguity is a challenge to analysis and to
      characterization. This &ldquo;nobleness&rdquo; on Mr. Parsons&rsquo; part is the element of
      style&mdash;something large and manly, expressive of the total character
      of his facts. His landscape is the landscape of the male vision, and yet
      his touch is full of sentiment, of curiosity and endearment. These things,
      and others besides, make him the most interesting, the most living, of the
      new workers in his line. And what shall I say of the other things besides?
      How can I take precautions enough to say that among the new workers,
      deeply English as he is, there is comparatively something French in his
      manner? Many people will like him because they see in him&mdash;or they
      think they do&mdash;a certain happy mean. Will they not fancy they catch
      him taking the middle way between the unsociable French <i>étude</i> and
      the old-fashioned English &ldquo;picture&rdquo;? If one of these extremes is a desert,
      the other, no doubt, is an oasis still more vain. I have a recollection of
      productions of Mr. Alfred Parsons&rsquo; which might have come from a Frenchman
      who was in love with English river-sides. I call to mind no studies&mdash;if
      he has made any&mdash;of French scenery; but if I did they would doubtless
      appear English enough. It is the fashion among sundry to maintain that the
      English landscape is of no use for <i>la peinture sérieuse</i>, that it is
      wanting in technical accent and is in general too storytelling, too
      self-conscious and dramatic also too lumpish and stodgy, of a green&mdash;<i>d&rsquo;un
      vert bête</i>&mdash;which, when reproduced, looks like that of the chromo.
      Certain it is that there are many hands which are not to be trusted with
      it, and taste and integrity have been known to go down before it. But
      Alfred Parsons may be pointed to as one who has made the luxuriant and
      lovable things of his own country almost as &ldquo;serious&rdquo; as those familiar
      objects&mdash;the pasture and the poplar&mdash;which, even when infinitely
      repeated by the great school across the Channel, strike us as but meagre
      morsels of France.

    </div>
    <p>
      In speaking of Mr. George H. Boughton, A.R.A., I encounter the same
      difficulty as with Mr. Millet: I find the window closed through which
      alone almost it is just to take a view of his talent. Mr. Boughton is a
      painter about whom there is little that is new to tell to-day, so
      conspicuous and incontestable is his achievement, the fruit of a career of
      which the beginning was not yesterday. He is a draughtsman and an
      illustrator only on occasion and by accident. These accidents have mostly
      occurred, however, in the pages of Harper, and the happiest of them will
      still be fresh in the memory of its readers. In the <i>Sketching Rambles
      in Holland</i> Mr. Abbey was a participant (as witness, among many things,
      the admirable drawing of the old Frisian woman bent over her Bible in
      church, with the heads of the burghers just visible above the rough
      archaic pew-tops&mdash;a drawing opposite to page 112 in the handsome
      volume into which these contributions were eventually gathered together);
      but most of the sketches were Mr. Boughton&rsquo;s, and the charming, amusing
      text is altogether his, save in the sense that it commemorates his
      companion&rsquo;s impressions as well as his own&mdash;the delightful,
      irresponsible, visual, sensual, pictorial, capricious impressions of a
      painter in a strange land, the person surely whom at particular moments
      one would give most to be. If there be anything happier than the
      impressions of a painter, it is the impressions of two, and the
      combination is set forth with uncommon spirit and humor in this frank
      record of the innocent lust of the eyes. Mr. Boughton scruples little, in
      general, to write as well as to draw, when the fancy takes him; to write
      in the manner of painters, with the bold, irreverent, unconventional,
      successful brush. If I were not afraid of the patronizing tone I would say
      that there is little doubt that if as a painter he had not had to try to
      write in character, he would certainly have made a characteristic writer.
      He has the most enviable &ldquo;finds,&rdquo; not dreamed of in timid literature, yet
      making capital descriptive prose. Other specimens of them may be
      encountered in two or three Christmas tales, signed with the name whose
      usual place is the corner of a valuable canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Boughton is in this manner not a simple talent, further
      complications and reversions may be observed in him, as, for instance,
      that having reverted from America, where he spent his early years, back to
      England, the land of his origin, he has now in a sense oscillated again
      from the latter to the former country. He came to London one day years ago
      (from Paris, where he had been eating nutritively of the tree of artistic
      knowledge), in order to re-embark on the morrow for the United States; but
      that morrow never came&mdash;it has never come yet. Certainly now it never
      <i>can</i> come, for the country that Mr. Boughton left behind him in his
      youth is no longer there; the &ldquo;old New York&rdquo; is no longer a port to sail
      to, unless for phantom ships. In imagination, however, the author of &ldquo;The
      Return of the <i>Mayflower</i>&rdquo; has several times taken his way back; he
      has painted with conspicuous charm and success various episodes of the
      early Puritan story. He was able on occasion to remember vividly enough
      the low New England coast and the thin New England air. He has been
      perceptibly an inventor, calling into being certain types of face and
      dress, certain tones and associations of color (all in the line of what I
      should call subdued harmonies if I were not afraid of appearing to talk a
      jargon), which people are hungry for when they acquire &ldquo;a Boughton,&rdquo; and
      which they can obtain on no other terms. This pictorial element in which
      he moves is made up of divers delicate things, and there would be a
      roughness in attempting to unravel the tapestry. There is old English, and
      old American, and old Dutch in it, and a friendly, unexpected new Dutch
      too&mdash;an ingredient of New Amsterdam&mdash;a strain of Knickerbocker
      and of Washington Irving. There is an admirable infusion of landscape in
      it, from which some people regret that Mr. Boughton should ever have
      allowed himself to be distracted by his importunate love of sad-faced,
      pretty women in close-fitting coifs and old silver-clasped cloaks. And
      indeed, though his figures are very &ldquo;tender,&rdquo; his landscape is to my sense
      tenderer still. Moreover, Mr. Boughton bristles, not aggressively, but in
      the degree of a certain conciliatory pertinacity, with contradictious
      properties. He lives in one of the prettiest and most hospitable houses in
      London, but the note of his work is the melancholy of rural things, of
      lonely people and of quaint, far-off legend and refrain. There is a
      delightful ambiguity of period and even of clime in him, and he rejoices
      in that inability to depict the modern which is the most convincing sign
      of the contemporary. He has a genius for landscape, yet he abounds in
      knowledge of every sort of ancient fashion of garment; the buckles and
      button-holes, the very shoe-ties, of the past are dear to him. It is
      almost always autumn or winter in his pictures. His horizons are cold, his
      trees are bare (he does the bare tree beautifully), and his draperies
      lined with fur; but when he exhibits himself directly, as in the fantastic
      &ldquo;Rambles&rdquo; before mentioned, contagious high spirits are the clearest of
      his showing. Here he appears as an irrepressible felicitous sketcher, and
      I know no pleasanter record of the joys of sketching, or even of those of
      simply looking. Théophile Gautier himself was not more inveterately
      addicted to this latter wanton exercise. There ought to be a pocket
      edition of Mr. Boughton&rsquo;s book, which would serve for travellers in other
      countries too, give them the point of view and put them in the mood. Such
      a blessing, and such a distinction too, is it to have an eye. Mr.
      Boughton&rsquo;s, in his good-humored Dutch wanderings, holds from morning till
      night a sociable, graceful revel. From the moment it opens till the moment
      it closes, its day is a round of adventures. His jolly pictorial
      narrative, reflecting every glint of October sunshine and patch of russet
      shade, tends to confirm us afresh in the faith that the painter&rsquo;s life is
      the best life, the life that misses fewest impressions.

    <p>
      Mr. Du Maurier has a brilliant history, but it must be candidly recognized
      that it is written or drawn mainly in an English periodical. It is only
      during the last two or three years that the most ironical of the artists
      of <i>Punch</i> has exerted himself for the entertainment of the readers
      of Harper; but I seem to come too late with any commentary on the nature
      of his satire or the charm of his execution. When he began to appear in
      Harper he was already an old friend, and for myself I confess I have to go
      through rather a complicated mental operation to put into words what I
      think of him. What does a man think of the language he has learned to
      speak? He judges it only while he is learning. Mr. Du Maurier&rsquo;s work, in
      regard to the life it embodies, is not so much a thing we see as one of
      the conditions of seeing. He has interpreted for us for so many years the
      social life of England that the interpretation has become the text itself.
      We have accepted his types, his categories, his conclusions, his
      sympathies and his ironies, It is not given to all the world to thread the
      mazes of London society, and for the great body of the disinherited, the
      vast majority of the Anglo-Saxon public. Mr. Du Maurier&rsquo;s representation
      is the thing represented. Is the effect of it to nip in the bud any remote
      yearning for personal participation? I feel tempted to say yes, when I
      think of the follies, the flatnesses, the affectations and stupidities
      that his teeming pencil has made vivid. But that vision immediately merges
      itself in another&mdash;a panorama of tall, pleasant, beautiful people,
      placed in becoming attitudes, in charming gardens, in luxurious rooms, so
      that I can scarcely tell which is the more definite, the impression
      satiric or the impression plastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This I take to be a sign that Mr. Du Maurier knows how to be general and
      has a conception of completeness. The world amuses him, such queer things
      go on in it; but the part that amuses him most is certain lines of our
      personal structure. That amusement is the brightest; the other is often
      sad enough. A sharp critic might accuse Mr. Du Maurier of lingering too
      complacently on the lines in question; of having a certain ideal of
      &ldquo;lissome&rdquo; elongation to which the promiscuous truth is sometimes
      sacrificed. But in fact this artist&rsquo;s P truth never pretends to be
      promiscuous; it is avowedly select and specific. What he depicts is so
      preponderantly the &ldquo;tapering&rdquo; people that the remainder of the picture, in
      a notice as brief as the present, may be neglected. If his <i>dramatis
      personæ</i> are not all the tenants of drawing-rooms, they are represented
      at least in some relation to these. &lsquo;Arry and his friends at the fancy
      fair are in society for the time; the point of introducing them is to show
      how the contrast intensifies them. Of late years Mr. Du Maurier has
      perhaps been a little too docile to the muse of elegance; the
      idiosyncrasies of the &ldquo;masher&rdquo; and the high girl with elbows have beguiled
      him into occasional inattention to the doings of the short and shabby. But
      his career has been long and rich, and I allude, in such words, but to a
      moment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral of it&mdash;I refer to the artistic one&mdash;seen altogether,
      is striking and edifying enough. What Mr. Du Maurier has attempted to do
      is to give, in a thousand interrelated drawings, a general satiric picture
      of the social life of his time and country. It is easy to see that through
      them &ldquo;an increasing purpose runs;&rdquo; they all hang together and refer to
      each other&mdash;complete, confirm, correct, illuminate each other.
      Sometimes they are not satiric: satire is not pure charm, and the artist
      has allowed himself to &ldquo;go in&rdquo; for pure charm. Sometimes he has allowed
      himself to go in for pure fantasy, so that satire (which should hold on to
      the mane of the real) slides off the other side of the runaway horse. But
      he remains, on the whole, pencil in hand, a wonderfully copious and
      veracious historian of his age and his civilization.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have left Mr. Reinhart to the last because of his importance, and now
      this very importance operates as a restriction and even as a sort of
      reproach to me. To go well round him at a deliberate pace would take a
      whole book. With Mr. Abbey, Mr. Reinhart is the artist who has contributed
      most abundantly to Harper; his work, indeed, in quantity, considerably
      exceeds Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s. He is the observer of the immediate, as Mr. Abbey is
      that of the considerably removed, and the conditions he asks us to accept
      are less expensive to the imagination than those of his colleague. He is,
      in short, the vigorous, racy <i>prosateur</i> of that human comedy of
      which Mr. Abbey is the poet. He illustrates the modern sketch of travel,
      the modern tale&mdash;the poor little &ldquo;quiet,&rdquo; psychological,
      conversational modern tale, which I often think the artist invited to
      represent it to the eye must hate, unless he be a very intelligent master,
      little, on a superficial view, would there appear to be in it to
      represent. The superficial view is, after all, the natural one for the
      picture-maker. A talent of the first order, however, only wants to be set
      thinking, as a single word will often make it. Mr. Reinhart at any rate,
      triumphs; whether there be life or not in the little tale itself, there is
      unmistakable life in his version of it. Mr. Reinhart deals in that element
      purely with admirable frankness and vigor. He is not so much suggestive as
      positively and sharply representative. His facility, his agility, his
      universality are a truly stimulating sight. He asks not too many questions
      of his subject, but to those he does ask he insists upon a thoroughly
      intelligible answer. By his universality I mean perhaps as much as
      anything else his admirable drawing; not precious, as the æsthetic say,
      nor pottering, as the vulgar, but free, strong and secure, which enables
      him to do with the human figure at a moment&rsquo;s notice anything that any
      occasion may demand. It gives him an immense range, and I know not how to
      express (it is not easy) my sense of a certain capable indifference that
      is in him otherwise than by saying that he would quite as soon do one
      thing as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it is true that the admirer of his work rather misses in him that
      intimation of a secret preference which many strong draughtsmen show, and
      which is not absent, for instance (I don&rsquo;t mean the secret, but the
      intimation), from the beautiful doings of Mr. Abbey. It is extremely
      present in Mr. Du Maurier&rsquo;s work, just as it was visible, less elusively,
      in that of John Leech, his predecessor in <i>Punch</i>. Mr. Abbey has a
      haunting type; Du Maurier has a haunting type. There was little perhaps of
      the haunted about Leech, but we know very well how he wanted his pretty
      girls, his British swell, and his &ldquo;hunting men&rdquo; to look. He betrayed a
      predilection; he had his little ideal. That an artist may be a great force
      and not have a little ideal, the scarcely too much to be praised Charles
      Keene is there (I mean he is in <i>Punch</i>) to show us. He has not a
      haunting type&mdash;not he&mdash;and I think that no one has yet
      discovered how he would have liked his pretty girls to look. He has kept
      the soft conception too much to himself&mdash;he has not trifled with the
      common truth by letting it appear. This common truth, in its innumerable
      combinations, is what Mr. Rein-hart also shows us (with of course
      infinitely less of a <i>parti pris</i> of laughing at it), though, as I
      must hasten to add, the female face and form in his hands always happen to
      take on a much lovelier cast than in Mr. Keene&rsquo;s. These things with him,
      however, are not a private predilection, an artist&rsquo;s dream. Mr. Reinhart
      is solidly an artist, but I doubt whether as yet he dreams, and the
      absence of private predilections makes him seem a little hard. He is
      sometimes rough with our average humanity, and especially rough with the
      feminine portion of it. He usually represents American life, in which that
      portion is often spoken of as showing to peculiar advantage. But Mr.
      Reinhart sees it generally, as very <i>bourgeois</i>. His good ladies are
      apt to be rather thick and short, rather huddled and plain. I shouldn&rsquo;t
      mind it so much if they didn&rsquo;t look so much alive. They are incontestably
      possible. The long, brilliant series of drawings he made to accompany Mr.
      Charles Dudley Warner&rsquo;s papers on the American watering-places form a rich
      <i>bourgeois</i> epic, which imaginations haunted by a type must accept
      with philosophy, for the sketches in question will have carried the tale,
      and all sorts of irresistible illusion with it, to the four corners of the
      earth. Full of observation and reality, of happy impressionism, taking all
      things as they come, with many a charming picture of youthful
      juxtaposition, they give us a sense, to which nothing need be added, of
      the energy of Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s pencil. They are a final collection of
      pictorial notes on the manners and customs, the aspects and habitats, in
      July and August, of the great American democracy; of which, certainly,
      taking one thing with another, they give a very comfortable, cheerful
      account. But they confirm that analytic view of which I have ventured to
      give a hint&mdash;the view of Mr. Reinhart as an artist of immense
      capacity who yet somehow doesn&rsquo;t care. I must add that this aspect of him
      is modified, in the one case very gracefully, in the other by the
      operation of a sort of constructive humor, remarkably strong, in his
      illustrations of Spanish life and his sketches of the Berlin political
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fashion of remaining outside, as it were, makes him (to the analyst)
      only the more interesting, for the analyst, if he have any critical life
      in him, will be prone to wonder <i>why</i> he doesn&rsquo;t care, and whether
      matters may not be turned about in such a way as that he should, with the
      consequence that his large capacity would become more fruitful still. Mr.
      Reinhart is open to the large appeal of Paris, where he lives&mdash;as is
      evident from much of his work&mdash;where he paints, and where, in crowded
      exhibitions, reputation and honors have descended upon him. And yet Paris,
      for all she may have taught him, has not given him the mystic sentiment&mdash;about
      which I am perhaps writing nonsense. Is it nonsense to say that, being
      very much an incarnation of the modern international spirit (he might be a
      Frenchman in New York were he not an American in Paris), the moral of his
      work is possibly the inevitable want of finality, of intrinsic character,
      in that sweet freedom? Does the cosmopolite necessarily pay for his
      freedom by a want of function&mdash;the impersonality of not being
      representative? Must one be a little narrow to have a sentiment, and very
      local to have a quality, or at least a style; and would the missing type,
      if I may mention it yet again, haunt our artist&mdash;who is somehow, in
      his rare instrumental facility, outside of quality and style&mdash;a good
      deal more if he were not, amid the mixture of associations and the
      confusion of races, liable to fall into vagueness as to what types are? He
      can do anything he likes; by which I mean he can do wonderfully even the
      things he doesn&rsquo;t like. But he strikes me as a force not yet fully used.

    <h2>
      EDWIN A. ABBE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing is more interesting in the history of an artistic talent than the
      moment at which its &ldquo;elective affinity&rdquo; declares itself, and the interest
      is great in proportion as the declaration is unmistakable. I mean by the
      elective affinity of a talent its climate and period of preference, the
      spot on the globe or in the annals of mankind to which it most fondly
      attaches itself, to which it reverts incorrigibly, round which it revolves
      with a curiosity that is insatiable, from which in short it draws its
      strongest inspiration. A man may personally inhabit a certain place at a
      certain time, but in imagination he may be a perpetual absentee, and to a
      degree worse than the worst Irish landlord, separating himself from his
      legal inheritance not only by mountains and seas, but by centuries as
      well. When he is a man of genius these perverse predilections become
      fruitful and constitute a new and independent life, and they are indeed to
      a certain extent the sign and concomitant of genius. I do not mean by this
      that high ability would always rather have been born in another country
      and another age, but certainly it likes to choose, it seldom fails to
      react against imposed conditions. If it accepts them it does so because it
      likes them for themselves; and if they fail to commend themselves it
      rarely scruples to fly away in search of others. We have witnessed this
      flight in many a case; I admit that if we have sometimes applauded it we
      have felt at other moments that the discontented, undomiciled spirit had
      better have stayed at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abbey has gone afield, and there could be no better instance of a
      successful fugitive and a genuine affinity, no more interesting example of
      selection&mdash;selection of field and subject&mdash;operating by that
      insight which has the precocity and certainty of an instinct. The domicile
      of Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s genius is the England of the eighteenth century; I should
      add that the palace of art which he has erected there commands&mdash;from
      the rear, as it were&mdash;various charming glimpses of the preceding age.
      The finest work he has yet done is in his admirable illustrations, in
      Harper&rsquo;s Magazine, to &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer,&rdquo; but the promise that he
      would one day do it was given some years ago in his delightful volume of
      designs to accompany Herrick&rsquo;s poems; to which we may add, as
      supplementary evidence, his drawings for Mr. William Black&rsquo;s novel of <i>Judith
      Shakespeare</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abbey was born in Philadelphia in 1852, and manifesting his brilliant
      but un-encouraged aptitudes at a very early age, came in 1872 to New York
      to draw for Harper&rsquo;s WEEKLY. Other views than this, if I have been
      correctly Informed, had been entertained for his future&mdash;a fact that
      provokes a smile now that his manifest destiny has been, or is in course
      of being, so very neatly accomplished. The spirit of modern aesthetics did
      not, at any rate, as I understand the matter, smile upon his cradle, and
      the circumstance only increases the interest of his having had from the
      earliest moment the clearest artistic vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has sometimes happened that the distinguished draughtsman or painter
      has been born in the studio and fed, as it were, from the palette, but in
      the great majority of cases he has been nursed by the profane, and
      certainly, on the doctrine of mathematical chances, a Philadelphia genius
      would scarcely be an exception. Mr. Abbey was fortunate, however, in not
      being obliged to lose time; he learned how to swim by jumping into deep
      water. Even if he had not known by instinct how to draw, he would have had
      to perform the feat from the moment that he found himself attached to the
      &ldquo;art department&rdquo; of a remarkably punctual periodical. In such a periodical
      the events of the day are promptly reproduced; and with the morrow so near
      the day is necessarily a short one&mdash;too short for gradual education.
      Such a school is not, no doubt, the ideal one, but in fact it may have a
      very happy influence. If a youth is to give an account of a scene with his
      pencil at a certain hour&mdash;to give it, as it were, or perish&mdash;he
      will have become conscious, in the first place, of a remarkable incentive
      to observe it. so that the roughness of the foster-mother who imparts the
      precious faculty of quick, complete observation is really a blessing in
      disguise. To say that it was simply under this kind of pressure that Mr.
      Abbey acquired the extraordinary refinement which distinguishes his work
      in black and white is doubtless to say too much; but his admirers may be
      excused, in view of the beautiful result, for almost wishing, on grounds
      of patriotism, to make the training, or the absence of training,
      responsible for as much as possible. For as no artistic genius that our
      country has produced is more delightful than Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s, so, surely,
      nothing could be more characteristically American than that it should have
      formed itself in the conditions that happened to be nearest at hand, with
      the crowds, streets and squares, the railway stations and telegraph poles,
      the wondrous sign-boards and triumphant bunting, of New York for the
      source of its inspiration, and with a big hurrying printing-house for its
      studio. If to begin the practice of art in these conditions was to incur
      the danger of being crude, Mr. Abbey braved it with remarkable success. At
      all events, if he went neither I through the mill of Paris nor through
      that of Munich, the writer of these lines more than consoles himself for
      the accident. His talent is unsurpassably fine, and yet we reflect with
      complacency that he picked it up altogether at home. If he is highly
      distinguished he is irremediably native, and (premising always that I
      speak mainly of his work in black and white) it is difficult to see, as we
      look, for instance, at the admirable series of his drawings for &ldquo;She
      Stoops to Conquer,&rdquo; what more Paris or Munich could have done for him.
      There is a certain refreshment in meeting an American artist of the first
      order who is not a pupil of Gérôme or of Cabanel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I hasten to add, we must make our account with the fact that,
      as I began with remarking, the great development of Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s powers has
      taken place amid the brown old accessories of a country where that
      eighteenth century which he presently marked for his own are more
      profusely represented than they have the good-fortune to be in America,
      and consequently limit our contention to the point that his talent itself
      was already formed when this happy initiation was opened to it. He went to
      England for the first time in 1878. but it was not all at once that he
      fell into the trick, so irresistible for an artist doing his special work,
      of living there, I must forbid myself every impertinent conjecture, but it
      may be respectfully assumed that Mr. Abbey rather drifted into exile than
      committed himself to it with malice prepense. The habit, at any rate,
      to-day appears to be confirmed, and, to express it roughly, he is
      surrounded by the utensils and conveniences that he requires. During these
      years, until the recent period when he began to exhibit at the water-color
      exhibitions, his work has been done principally for Harper&rsquo;s Magazine, and
      the record of it is to be found in the recent back volumes. I shall not
      take space to tell it over piece by piece, for the reader who turns to the
      Magazine will have no difficulty in recognizing it. It has a distinction
      altogether its own; there is always poetry, humor, charm, in the idea, and
      always infinite grace and security in the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have intimated, Mr. Abbey never deals with the things and figures of
      to-day; his imagination must perform a wide backward journey before it can
      take the air. But beyond this modern radius it breathes with singular
      freedom and naturalness. At a distance of fifty years it begins to be at
      home; it expands and takes possession; it recognizes its own. With all his
      ability, with all his tact, it would be impossible to him, we conceive, to
      illustrate a novel of contemporary manners; he would inevitably throw it
      back to the age of hair-powder and post-chaises. The coats and trousers,
      the feminine gear, the chairs and tables of the current year, the general
      aspect of things immediate and familiar, say nothing to his mind, and
      there are other interpreters to whom he is quite content to leave them. He
      shows no great interest even in the modern face, if there be a modern face
      apart from a modern setting; I am not sure what he thinks of its
      complications and refinements of expression, but he has certainly little
      relish for its <i>banal</i>, vulgar mustache, its prosaic, mercantile
      whisker, surmounting the last new thing in shirt-collars. Dear to him is
      the physiognomy of clean-shaven periods, when cheek and lip and chin,
      abounding in line and surface, had the air of soliciting the pencil.
      Impeccable as he is in drawing, he likes a whole face, with reason, and
      likes a whole figure; the latter not to the exclusion of clothes, in which
      he delights, but as the clothes of our great-grandfathers helped it to be
      seen. No one has ever understood breeches and stockings better than he, or
      the human leg, that delight of the draughtsman, as the costume of the last
      century permitted it to be known. The petticoat and bodice of the same
      period have as little mystery for him, and his women and girls have
      altogether the poetry of a by-gone manner and fashion. They are not modern
      heroines, with modern nerves and accomplishments, but figures of
      remembered song and story, calling up visions of spinet and harpsichord
      that have lost their music today, high-walled gardens that have ceased to
      bloom, flowered stuffs that are faded, locks of hair that are lost,
      love-letters that are pale. By which I don&rsquo;t mean that they are vague and
      spectral, for Mr. Abbey has in the highest degree the art of imparting
      life, and he gives it in particular to his well-made, blooming maidens.
      They live in a world in which there is no question of their passing
      Harvard or other examinations, but they stand very firmly on their
      quaintly-shod feet. They are exhaustively &ldquo;felt,&rdquo; and eminently qualified
      to attract the opposite sex, which is not the case with ghosts, who,
      moreover, do not wear the most palpable petticoats of quilted satin, nor
      sport the most delicate fans, nor take generally the most ingratiating
      attitudes.

    </div>
    <p>
      The best work that Mr. Abbey has done is to be found in the succession of
      illustrations to &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer;&rdquo; here we see his happiest
      characteristics and&mdash;till he does something still more brilliant&mdash;may
      take his full measure. No work in black and white in our time has been
      more truly artistic, and certainly no success more unqualified. The artist
      has given us an evocation of a social state to its smallest details, and
      done it with an unsurpassable lightness of touch. The problem was in
      itself delightful&mdash;the accidents and incidents (granted a situation
      <i>de comédie</i>) of an old, rambling, wainscoted, out-of-the-way English
      country-house, in the age of Goldsmith. Here Mr. Abbey is in his element&mdash;given
      up equally to unerring observation and still more infallible divination.
      The whole place, and the figures that come and go in it, live again, with
      their individual look, their peculiarities, their special signs and
      oddities. The spirit of the dramatist has passed completely into the
      artist&rsquo;s sense, but the spirit of the historian has done so almost as
      much. Tony Lumpkin is, as we say nowadays, a document, and Miss Hardcastle
      embodies the results of research. Delightful are the humor and quaintness
      and grace of all this, delightful the variety and the richness of personal
      characterization, and delightful, above all, the drawing. It is impossible
      to represent with such vividness unless, to begin with, one sees; and it
      is impossible to see unless one wants to very much, or unless, in other
      words, one has a great love. Mr. Abbey has evidently the tenderest
      affection for just the old houses and the old things, the old faces and
      voices, the whole irrevocable human scene which the genial hand of
      Goldsmith has passed over to him, and there is no inquiry about them that
      he is not in a position to answer. He is intimate with the buttons of
      coats and the buckles of shoes: he knows not only exactly what his people
      wore, but exactly how they wore it, and how they felt when they had it on.
      He has sat on the old chairs and sofas, and rubbed against the old
      wainscots, and leaned over the old balusters. He knows every mended place
      in Tony Lumpkin&rsquo;s stockings, and exactly how that ingenuous youth leaned
      back on the spinet, with his thick, familiar thumb out, when he presented
      his inimitable countenance, with a grin, to Mr. Hastings, after he had set
      his fond mother a-whimpering. (There is nothing in the whole series,
      by-the-way, better indicated than the exquisitely simple, half-bumpkin,
      half-vulgar expression of Tony&rsquo;s countenance and smile in this scene,
      unless it be the charming arch yet modest face of Miss Hardcastle, lighted
      by the candle she carries, as, still holding the door by which she comes
      in, she is challenged by young Mar-low to relieve his bewilderment as to
      where he really is and what <i>she</i> really is.) In short, if we have
      all seen &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer&rdquo; acted, Mr. Abbey has had the better
      fortune of seeing it off the stage; and it is noticeable how happily he
      has steered clear of the danger of making his people theatrical types&mdash;mere
      masqueraders and wearers of properties. This is especially the case with
      his women, who have not a hint of the conventional paint and patches,
      simpering with their hands in the pockets of aprons, but are taken from
      the same originals from which Goldsmith took them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it be asked on the occasion of this limited sketch of Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s
      powers where, after all, he did learn to draw so perfectly, I know no
      answer but to say that he learned it in the school in which he learned
      also to paint (as he has been doing in these latest years, rather
      tentatively at first, but with greater and greater success)&mdash;the
      school of his own personal observation. His drawing is the drawing of
      direct, immediate, solicitous study of the particular case, without tricks
      or affectations or any sort of cheap subterfuge, and nothing can exceed
      the charm of its delicacy, accuracy and elegance, its variety and freedom,
      its clear, frank solution of difficulties. If for the artist it be the
      foundation of every joy to know exactly what he wants (as I hold it is
      indeed), Mr. Abbey is, to all appearance, to be constantly congratulated.
      And I apprehend that he would not deny that it is a good-fortune for him
      to have been able to arrange his life so that his eye encounters in
      abundance the particular cases of which I speak. Two or three years ago,
      at the Institute of Painters in Water-colors, in London, he exhibited an
      exquisite picture of a peaceful old couple sitting in the corner of a low,
      quiet, ancient room, in the waning afternoon, and listening to their
      daughter as she stands up in the middle and plays the harp to them. They
      are Darby and Joan, with all the poetry preserved; they sit hand in hand,
      with bent, approving heads, and the deep recess of the window looking into
      the garden (where we may be sure there are yew-trees clipped into the
      shape of birds and beasts), the panelled room, the quaintness of the
      fireside, the old-time provincial expression of the scene, all belong to
      the class of effects which Mr. Abbey understands supremely well. So does
      the great russet wall and high-pitched mottled roof of the rural almshouse
      which figures in the admirable water-color picture that he exhibited last
      spring. A group of remarkably pretty countrywomen have been arrested in
      front of it by the passage of a young soldier&mdash;a raw recruit in
      scarlet tunic and white ducks, somewhat prematurely conscious of military
      glory. He gives them the benefit of the goose-step as he goes; he throws
      back his head and distends his fingers, presenting to the ladies a back
      expressive of more consciousness of his fine figure than of the lovely
      mirth that the artist has depicted in their faces. Lovely is their mirth
      indeed, and lovely are they altogether. Mr. Abbey has produced nothing
      more charming than this bright knot of handsome, tittering daughters of
      burghers, in their primeval pelisses and sprigged frocks. I have, however,
      left myself no space to go into the question of his prospective honors as
      a painter, to which everything now appears to point, and I have mentioned
      the two pictures last exhibited mainly because they illustrate the happy
      opportunities with which he has been able to surround himself. The sweet
      old corners he appreciates, the russet walls of moss-grown charities, the
      lowbrowed nooks of manor, cottage and parsonage, the fresh complexions
      that flourish in green, pastoral countries where it rains not a little&mdash;every
      item in this line that seems conscious of its pictorial use appeals to Mr.
      Abbey not in vain. He might have been a grandson of Washington Irving,
      which is a proof of what I have already said, that none of the young
      American workers in the same field have so little as he of that
      imperfectly assimilated foreignness of suggestion which is sometimes
      regarded as the strength, but which is also in some degree the weakness,
      of the pictorial effort of the United States. His execution is as sure of
      itself as if it rested upon infinite Parisian initiation, but his feeling
      can best be described by saying that it is that of our own dear
      mother-tongue. If the writer speaks when he writes, and the draughtsman
      speaks when he draws. Mr. Abbey, in expressing himself with his pencil,
      certainly speaks pure English, He reminds us to a certain extent of
      Meissonier, especially the Meissonier of the illustrations to that
      charming little volume of the <i>Conies Rémois</i>, and the comparison is
      highly to his advantage in the matter of freedom, variety, ability to
      represent movement (Meissonier&rsquo;s figures are stock-still), and facial
      expression&mdash;above all, in the handling of the female personage, so
      rarely attempted by the French artist. But he differs from the latter
      signally in the fact that though he shares his sympathy as to period and
      costume, his people are of another race and tradition, and move in a world
      locally altogether different. Mr. Abbey is still young, he is full of
      ideas and intentions, and the work he has done may, in view of his time of
      life, of his opportunities and the singular completeness of his talent, be
      regarded really as a kind of foretaste and prelude. It can hardly fail
      that he will do better things still, when everything is so favorable. Life
      itself is his subject, and that is always at his door. The only obstacle,
      therefore, that can be imagined in Mr. Abbey&rsquo;s future career is a possible
      embarrassment as to what to choose. He has hitherto chosen so well,
      however, that this obstacle will probably not be insuperable.

    <h2>
      CHARLES S. REINHART
    </h2>
    <p>
      We Americans are accused of making too much ado about our celebrities, of
      being demonstratively conscious of each step that we take in the path of
      progress; and the accusation has its ground doubtless in this sense, that
      it is possible among us to-day to become a celebrity on unprecedentedly
      easy terms. This, however, at the present hour is the case all the world
      over, and it is difficult to see where the standard of just renown remains
      so high that the first stone may be cast. It is more and more striking
      that the machinery of publicity is so enormous, so constantly growing and
      so obviously destined to make the globe small, in relation of the objects,
      famous or obscure, which cover it, that it procures for the smallest facts
      and the most casual figures a reverberation to be expected only in the
      case of a world-conqueror. The newspaper and the telegram constitute a
      huge sounding-board, which has, every day and every hour, to be made to
      vibrate, to be fed with items, and the diffusion of the items takes place
      on a scale out of any sort of proportion to their intrinsic importance.
      The crackle of common things is transmuted into thunder&mdash;a thunder
      perhaps more resounding in America than elsewhere for the reason that the
      sheet of tin shaken by the Jupiter of the Press has been cut larger. But
      the difference is only of degree, not of kind; and if the system we in
      particular have brought to perfection would seem to be properly applied
      only to Alexanders and Napoleons, it is not striking that these adequate
      subjects present themselves even in other countries. The end of it all
      surely no man can see, unless it be that collective humanity is destined
      to perish from a rupture of its tympanum. That is a theme for a later
      hour, and meanwhile perhaps it is well not to be too frightened. Some of
      the items I just spoke of are, after all, larger than others; and if, as a
      general thing, it is a mistake to pull up our reputations to see how they
      are growing, there are some so well grown that they will bear it, and
      others of a hardy stock even while they are tender. We may feel, for
      instance, comparatively little hesitation in extending an importunate hand
      towards the fine young sapling of which Mr. Reinhart is one of the
      branches. It is a plant of promise, which has already flowered profusely
      and the fragrance of which it would be affectation not to to notice. Let
      us notice it, then, with candor, for it has all the air of being destined
      to make the future sweeter. The plant in question is of course simply the
      art of illustration in black and white, to which American periodical
      literature has, lately given such an impetus and which has returned the
      good office by conferring a great distinction on our magazines. In its new
      phase the undertaking has succeeded; and it is not always that fortune
      descends upon so deserving a head. Two or three fine talents in particular
      have helped it to succeed, and Mr. Reinhart is not the least conspicuous
      of these. It would be idle for a writer in Harper to pretend to any
      diffidence of appreciation of his work: for the pages are studded, from
      many years back, with the record of his ability. Mr. Rein-hart took his
      first steps and made his first hits in Harper, which owes him properly a
      portrait in return for so much portraiture. I may exaggerate the charm and
      the importance of the modern illustrative form, may see in it a capacity
      of which it is not yet itself wholly conscious, but if I do so Mr.
      Reinhart is partly responsible for the aberration. Abundant, intelligent,
      interpretative work in black and white is, to the sense of the writer of
      these lines, one of the pleasantest things of the time, having only to
      rise to the occasion to enjoy a great future. This idea, I confess, is
      such as to lead one to write not only sympathetically but pleadingly about
      the artists to whom one looks for confirmation of it. If at the same time
      as we commemorate what they have done we succeed in enlarging a little the
      conception of what they may yet do, we shall be repaid even for having
      exposed ourselves as fanatics&mdash;fanatics of the general manner, I
      mean, not of particular representatives of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      May not this fanaticism, in a particular case, rest upon a sense of the
      resemblance between the general chance, as it may be called, of the
      draughtsman in black and white, with contemporary life for his theme, and
      the opportunity upon which the literary artist brings another form to
      bear? The forms are different, though with analogies; but the field is the
      same&mdash;the immense field of contemporary life observed for an artistic
      purpose. There is nothing so interesting as that, because it is ourselves;
      and no artistic problem is so charming as to arrive, either in a literary
      or a plastic form, at a close and direct notation of what we observe. If
      one has attempted some such exploit in a literary form, one cannot help
      having a sense of union and comradeship with those who have approached the
      question with the other instrument. This will be especially the case if we
      happen to have appreciated that instrument even to envy. We may as well
      say it outright, we envy it quite unspeakably in the hands of Mr. Reinhart
      and in those of Mr. Abbey. There is almost no limit to the service to
      which we can imagine it to be applied, and we find ourselves wishing that
      these gentlemen may be made adequately conscious of all the advantages it
      represents. We wonder whether they really <i>are</i> so; we are disposed
      even to assume that they are not, in order to join the moral, to insist on
      the lesson. The master whom we have mentally in view Mr. Reinhart is a
      near approach to him may be, if he will only completely know it, so
      prompt, so copious, so universal&mdash;so &ldquo;all there,&rdquo; as we say nowadays,
      and indeed so all everywhere. There is only too much to see, too much to
      do, and his process is the one that comes nearest to minimizing the
      quantity. He can touch so many things, he can go from one scene to
      another, he can sound a whole concert of notes while the painter is
      setting up his easel. The painter is majestic, dignified, academic,
      important, superior, anything you will; but he is, in the very nature of
      the case, only occasional. He is &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; but he is comparatively
      clumsy: he is a terrible time getting under way, and he has to sacrifice
      so many subjects while he is doing one. The illustrator makes one immense
      sacrifice, of course&mdash;that of color; but with it he purchases a
      freedom which enables him to attack ever so many ideas. It is by variety
      and numerosity that he commends himself to his age, and it is for these
      qualities that his age commends him to the next. The twentieth century,
      the latter half of it, will, no doubt, have its troubles, but it will have
      a great compensatory luxury, that of seeing the life of a hundred years
      before much more vividly than we&mdash;even happy we&mdash;see the life of
      a hundred years ago. But for this our illustrators must do their best,
      appreciate the endless capacity of their form. It is to the big picture
      what the short story is to the novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtless too much, I hasten to add, to ask Mr. Reinhart, for
      instance, to work to please the twentieth century. The end will not matter
      if he pursues his present very prosperous course of activity, for it is
      assuredly the fruitful vein, the one I express the hope to see
      predominant, the portrayal of the manners, types and aspects that surround
      us. Mr. Reinhart has reached that happy period of life when a worker is in
      full possession of his means, when he has done for his chosen instrument
      everything he can do in the way of forming it and rendering it complete
      and flexible, and has the fore only to apply it with freedom, confidence
      and success. These, to our sense, are the golden hours of an artist&rsquo;s
      life; happier even than the younger time when the future seemed infinite
      in the light of the first rays of glory, the first palpable hits. The very
      sense that the future is <i>not</i> unlimited and that opportunity is at
      its high-water-mark gives an intensity to the enjoyment of maturity. Then
      the acquired habit of &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; must simplify the problem of execution
      and leave the artist free to think only of his purpose, as befits a real
      creator. Mr. Reinhart is at the enviable stage of knowing in perfection
      how; he has arrived at absolute facility and felicity. The machine goes of
      itself; it is no longer necessary to keep lifting the cover and pouring in
      the oil of fond encouragement: all the attention may go to the idea and
      the subject. It may, however, remain very interesting to others to know
      how the faculty was trained, the pipe was tuned. The early phases of such
      a process have a relative importance even when, at the lime (so gradual
      are many beginnings and so obscure man a morrow) they may have appeared
      neither delightful nor profitable. They are almost always to be summed up
      in the single precious word practice. This word represents, at any rate,
      Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s youthful history, and the profusion in which, though no
      doubt occasionally disguised, the boon was supplied to him in the offices
      of Harper&rsquo;s Magazine. There is nothing so innate that it has not also to
      be learned, for the best part of any aptitude is the capacity to increase
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s experience began to accumulate very early, for at
      Pittsburgh, where he was born, he was free to draw to his heart&rsquo;s content.
      There was no romantic attempt, as I gather, to nip him in the bud. On the
      contrary, he was despatched with almost prosaic punctuality to Europe, and
      was even encouraged to make himself at home in Munich. Munich, in his
      case, was a <i>pis-aller</i> for Paris, where it would have been his
      preference to study when he definitely surrendered, as it were, to his
      symptoms. He went to Paris, but Paris seemed blocked and complicated, and
      Munich presented advantages which, if not greater, were at least easier to
      approach. Mr. Reinhart passe through the mill of the Bavarian school, and
      when it had turned him out with its characteristic polish he came back to
      America with a very substantial stock to dispose of. It would take a
      chapter by itself if we were writing a biography, this now very usual
      episode of the return of the young American from the foreign conditions in
      which he has learned his professional language, and his position in face
      of the community that he addresses in a strange idiom. There has to be a
      prompt adjustment between ear and voice, if the interlocutor is not to
      seem to himself to be intoning in the void. There is always an inner
      history in all this, as well as an outer one&mdash;such, however, as it
      would take much space to relate. Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s more or less alienated
      accent fell, by good-fortune, on a comprehending listener. He had made a
      satirical drawing, in the nature of the &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; of a comic journal, on a
      subject of the hour, and addressed it to the editor of <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i>.
      The drawing was not published&mdash;the satire was perhaps not exactly on
      the right note&mdash;but the draughtsman was introduced. Thus began, by
      return of post, as it were, and with preliminaries so few that they could
      not well have been less, a connection of many years. If I were writing a
      biography another chapter would come in here&mdash;a curious, almost a
      pathetic one; for the course of things is so rapid in this country that
      the years of Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s apprenticeship to pictorial journalism,
      positively recent as they are, already are almost prehistoric. To-morrow,
      at least, the complexion of that time, its processes, ideas and standards,
      together with some of the unsophisticated who carried them out, will
      belong to old New York. A certain mollifying dimness rests upon them now,
      and their superseded brilliancy gleams through it but faintly. It is a
      lively span for Mr. Reinhart to have been at once one of the
      unsophisticated and one of the actually modern.
    </p>
    <p>
      That portion of his very copious work to which, more particularly. I apply
      the latter term, has been done for Harper&rsquo;s Magazine. During these latter
      years it has come, like so much of American work to-day, from beyond the
      seas. Whether or not that foreign language of which I just spoke never
      became, in New York, for this especial possessor of it, a completely
      convenient medium of conversation, is more than I can say; at any rate Mr.
      Reinhart eventually reverted to Europe and settled in Paris. Paris had
      seemed rather inhospitable to him in his youth, but he has now fitted his
      key to the lock. It would be satisfactory to be able to express
      scientifically the reasons why, as a general thing, the American artist,
      as well as his congener of many another land, carries on his function with
      less sense of resistance in that city than elsewhere. He likes Paris best,
      but that is not scientific. The difference is that though theoretically
      the production of pictures is recognized in America and in England, in
      Paris it is recognized both theoretically and practically. And I do not
      mean by this simply that pictures are bought&mdash;for they are not,
      predominantly, as it happens&mdash;but that they are more presupposed. The
      plastic is implied in the French conception of things, and the studio is
      as natural a consequence of it as the post-office is of letter-writing.
      Vivid representation is the genius of the French language and the need of
      the French mind. The people have invented more aids to it than any other,
      and as these aids make up a large part of the artist&rsquo;s life, he feels his
      best home to be in the place where he finds them most. He may begin to
      quarrel with that home on the day a complication is introduced by the
      question of <i>what</i> he shall represent&mdash;a totally different
      consideration from that of the method; but for Mr. Reinhart this question
      has not yet offered insoluble difficulties. He represents everything&mdash;he
      has accepted so general an order. So long as his countrymen flock to Paris
      and pass in a homogeneous procession before his eyes, there is not the
      smallest difficulty in representing <i>them</i>. When the case requires
      that they shall be taken in connection with their native circumstances and
      seen in their ambient air, he is prepared to come home and give several
      months to the task, as on the occasion of Mr. Dudley Warner&rsquo;s history of a
      tour among the watering-places, to which he furnished so rich and so
      curious a pictorial accompaniment. Sketch-book in hand, he betakes
      himself, according to need, to Germany, to England, to Italy, to Spain.
      The readers of Harper will have forgotten his admirable pictorial notes on
      the political world at Berlin, so rich and close in characterization. To
      the <i>Spanish Vistas</i> of Mr. G. P. Lathrop he contributed innumerable
      designs, delightful notes of an artist&rsquo;s quest of the sketchable, many of
      which are singularly full pictures. The &ldquo;Soldiers Playing Dominoes&rdquo; at a
      café is a powerful page of life. Mr. Reinhart has, of course, interpreted
      many a fictive scene&mdash;he has been repeatedly called upon to make the
      novel and the story visible. This he energetically and patiently does;
      though of course we are unable to say whether the men and women he makes
      us see are the very people whom the authors have seen. That is a thing
      that, in any case, one will never know; besides, the authors who don&rsquo;t see
      vaguely are apt to see perversely. The story-teller has, at any rate, the
      comfort with Mr. Reinhart that his drawings are constructive and have the
      air of the actual. He likes to represent character&mdash;he rejoices in
      the specifying touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evidence of this is to be found also in his pictures, for I ought
      already to have mentioned that, for these many years (they are beginning
      to be many), he has indulged in the luxury of color. It is not probable
      that he regards himself in the first place as an illustrator, in the sense
      to which the term is usually restricted. He is a very vigorous and various
      painter, and at the Salon a constant and conspicuous exhibitor. He is fond
      of experiments, difficulties and dangers, and I divine that it would be
      his preference to be known best by his painting, in which he handles
      landscape with equal veracity. It is a pity that the critic is unable to
      contend with him on such a point without appearing to underestimate that
      work. Mr. Reinhart has so much to show for his preference that I am
      conscious of its taking some assurance to say that I am not sure he is
      right. This would be the case even if he had nothing else to show than the
      admirable picture entitled &ldquo;Washed Ashore&rdquo; (&ldquo;Un Epave &ldquo;) which made such
      an impression in the Salon of 1887. It represents the dead body of an
      unknown man whom the tide has cast up, lying on his back, feet forward,
      disfigured, dishonored by the sea. A small group of villagers are
      collected near it, divided by the desire to look and the fear to see. A
      gendarme, official and responsible, his uniform contrasting with the
      mortal disrepair of the victim, takes down in his note-book the <i>procès-verbal</i>
      of the incident, and an old sailor, pointing away with a stiffened arm,
      gives him the benefit of what <i>he</i> knows about the matter. Plain,
      pitying, fish-wives, hushed, with their shawls in their mouths, hang back,
      as if from a combination too solemn&mdash;the mixture of death and the
      law. Three or four men seem to be glad it isn&rsquo;t they. The thing is a
      masterpiece of direct representation, and has wonderfully the air of
      something seen, found without being looked for. Excellently composed but
      not artificial, deeply touching but not sentimental, large, close and
      sober, this important work gives the full measure of Mr. Reinhart&rsquo;s great
      talent and constitutes a kind of pledge. It may be perverse on my part to
      see in it the big banknote, as it were, which may be changed into a
      multitude of gold and silver pieces. I cannot, however, help doing so.
      &ldquo;Washed Ashore&rdquo; is painted as only a painter paints, but I irreverently
      translate it into its equivalent in &ldquo;illustrations&rdquo;&mdash;half a hundred
      little examples, in black and white, of the same sort of observation. For
      this observation, immediate, familiar, sympathetic, human, and not
      involving a quest of style for which color is really indispensable, is a
      mistress at whose service there is no derogation in placing one&rsquo;s self. To
      do little things instead of big <i>may</i> be a derogation; a great deal
      will depend upon the way the little things are done. Besides, no work of
      art is absolutely little. I grow bold and even impertinent as I think of
      the way Mr. Rein-hart might scatter the smaller coin. At any rate,
      whatever proportion his work in this line may bear to the rest, it is to
      be hoped that nothing will prevent him from turning out more and more to
      play the rare faculty that produces it. His studies of American <i>moeurs</i>
      in association with Mr. Warner went so far on the right road that we would
      fain see him make all the rest of the journey. They made us ask
      straightway for more, and were full of intimations of what was behind.
      They showed what there is to see&mdash;what there is to guess. Let him
      carry the same inquiry further, let him carry it all the way. It would be
      serious work and would abound in reality; it would help us, as it were, to
      know what we are talking about. In saying this I feel how much I confirm
      the great claims I just made for the revival of illustration.

    <h2>
      ALFRED PARSONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would perhaps be extravagant to pretend, in this embarrassed age, that
      Merry England is still intact; but it would be strange if the words &ldquo;happy
      England&rdquo; should not rise to the lips of the observer of Mr. Alfred
      Parsons&rsquo; numerous and delightful studies of the gardens, great and small,
      of his country. They surely have a representative value in more than the
      literal sense, and might easily minister to the quietest complacency of
      patriotism. People whose criticism is imaginative will see in them a kind
      of compendium of what, in home things, is at once most typical and most
      enviable; and, going further, they will almost wish that such a collection
      might be carried by slow stages round the globe, to kindle pangs in the
      absent and passions in the alien. As it happens to be a globe the English
      race has largely peopled, we can measure the amount of homesickness that
      would be engendered on the way. In fact, one doubts whether the sufferer
      would even need to be of English strain to attach the vision of home to
      the essentially lovable places that Mr. Parsons depicts. They seem to
      generalize and typify the idea, so that every one may feel, in every case,
      that he has a sentimental property in the scene. The very sweetness of its
      reality only helps to give it that story-book quality which persuades us
      we have known it in youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet such scenes may well have been constructed for the despair of the
      Colonial; for they remind us, at every glance, of that perfection to which
      there is no short cut&mdash;not even &ldquo;unexampled prosperity &ldquo;&mdash;and to
      which time is the only guide. Mr. Parsons&rsquo; pictures speak of many
      complicated things, but (in what they tell us of his subjects) they speak
      most of duration. Such happy nooks have grown slowly, such fortunate
      corners have had a history; and their fortune has been precisely that they
      have had time to have it comfortably, have not been obliged to try for
      character without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Character is their strong point and the most expensive of all ingredients.
      Mr. Parsons&rsquo; portraiture seizes every shade of it, seizes it with
      unfailing sympathy. He is doubtless clever enough to paint rawness when he
      must, but he has an irrepressible sense of ripeness. Half the ripeness of
      England&mdash;half the religion, one might almost say&mdash;is in its
      gardens; they are truly pious foundations. It is doubtless because there
      are so many of them that the country seems so finished, and the sort of
      care they demand is an intenser deliberation, which passes into the
      national temper. One must have lived in other lands to observe fully how
      large a proportion of this one is walled in for growing flowers. The
      English love of flowers is inveterate; it is the most, unanimous protest
      against the grayness of some of the conditions, and it should receive
      justice from those who accuse the race of taking its pleasure too sadly. A
      good garden is an organized revel, and there is no country in which there
      are so many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parsons had therefore only to choose, at his leisure, and one might
      heartily have envied him the process, scarcely knowing which to prefer of
      all the pleasant pilgrimages that would make up such a quest. He had.
      fortunately, the knowledge which could easily lead to more, and a career
      of discovery behind him. He knew the right times for the right things, and
      the right things for the right places. He had innumerable memories and
      associations; he had painted up and down the land and looked over many
      walls. He had followed the bounty of the year from month to month and from
      one profusion to another. To follow it with him, in this admirable series,
      is to see that he is master of the subject. There will be no lack of
      confidence on the part of those who have already perceived, in much of Mr.
      Parsons&rsquo; work, a supreme illustration of all that is widely nature-loving
      in the English interest in the flower. No sweeter submission to mastery
      can be imagined than the way the daffodils, under his brush (to begin at
      the beginning), break out into early April in the lovely drawings of
      Stourhead. One of the most charming of these&mdash;a corner of an old
      tumbled-up place in Wiltshire, where many things have come and gone&mdash;represents
      that moment of transition in which contrast is so vivid as to make it more
      dramatic than many plays&mdash;the very youngest throb of spring, with the
      brown slope of the foreground coming back to consciousness in pale
      lemon-colored patches and, on the top of the hill, against the still cold
      sky, the equally delicate forms of the wintry trees. By the time these
      forms have thickened, the expanses of daffodil will have become a mass of
      bluebells. All the daffodil pictures have a rare loveliness, but
      especially those that deal also with the earlier fruit-blossom, the young
      plum-trees in Berkshire orchards. Here the air is faintly pink, and the
      painter makes us feel the little <i>blow</i> in the thin blue sky. The
      spring, fortunately, is everybody&rsquo;s property and, in the language of all
      the arts, the easiest word to conjure with. It is therefore partly Mr.
      Parsons&rsquo; good-luck that we enjoy so his rendering of these phases; but on
      the other hand we look twice when it&rsquo;s a case of meddling with the
      exquisite, and if he inspires us with respect it is because we feel that
      he has been deeply initiated. No one knows better the friendly reasons for
      our stopping, when chatting natives pronounce the weather &ldquo;foine,&rdquo; at
      charming casual corners of old villages, where grassy ways cross each
      other and timbered houses bulge irregularly and there are fresh things
      behind crooked palings; witness the little vision of Blewbury, in
      Berkshire, reputedly of ancient British origin, with a road all round it
      and only footways within. No one, in the Herefordshire orchards, masses
      the white cow-parsley in such profusion under the apple blossoms; or makes
      the whitewashed little damson-trees look so innocently responsible and
      charming on the edge of the brook over which the planks are laid for the
      hens. Delightful, in this picture, is the sense of the clean spring day,
      after rain, with the blue of the sky washed faint. Delightful is the
      biggish view (one of the less numerous oil-pictures) of the Somersetshire
      garden, where that peculiarly English look of the open-air room is
      produced by the stretched carpet of the turf and the firm cushions of the
      hedges, and a pair of proprietors, perhaps happier than they know, are
      putting in an afternoon among their tulips, under the flushed apple-trees
      whose stems are so thin and whose brims so heavy. Are the absorbed couple,
      at any rate, aware of the surprising degree to which the clustered ruddy
      roofs of the next small town, over the hedge, off at the left, may remind
      the fanciful spectator of the way he has seen little dim Italian cities
      look on their hill-tops? The whole thing, in this subject, has the
      particular English note to which Mr. Parsons repeatedly testifies, the
      nook quality, the air of a land and a life so infinitely subdivided that
      they produce a thousand pleasant privacies. The painter moves with the
      months and finds, after the earliest things, the great bed of pansies in
      the angle of the old garden at Sutton, in which, for felicity of position
      and perfect pictorial service rendered&mdash;to say nothing of its
      polygonal, pyramidal roof&mdash;the ancient tool-house, or tea-house, is
      especially to be commended. Very far descended is such a corner as this,
      very full of reference to vanished combinations and uses; and the artist
      communicates to us a feeling for it that makes us wish disinterstedly it
      may be still as long preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finds in June, at Blackdown, the blaze of the yellow azalea-bush, or in
      another spot the strong pink of the rhododendron, beneath the silver firs
      that deepen the blue of the sky. He finds the Vicarage Walk, at King&rsquo;s
      Langley, a smother of old-fashioned flowers&mdash;a midsummer vista for
      the figures of a happy lady and a lucky dog. He finds the delicious huddle
      of the gabled, pigeon-haunted roof of a certain brown old building at
      Frame, with poppies and gladiolus and hollyhock crowding the beautiful
      foreground. He finds&mdash;apparently in the same place&mdash;the tangle
      of the hardy flowers that come while the roses are still in bloom, with
      the tall blue larkspurs standing high among them. He finds the lilies,
      white and red, at Broadway, and the poppies, which have dropped most of
      their petals&mdash;apparently to let the roses, which are just coming out,
      give <i>their</i> grand party. Their humility is rewarded by the artist&rsquo;s
      admirable touch in the little bare poppy-heads that nod on their flexible
      pins.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I cannot go on to say everything that such a seeker, such a
      discoverer, as Mr. Parsons finds&mdash;the less that the purpose of these
      limited remarks is to hint at our own <i>trouvailles</i>. A view of the
      field, at any rate, would be incomplete without such specimens as the
      three charming oil-pictures which commemorate Holme Lacey. There are
      gardens and gardens, and these represent the sort that are always spoken
      of in the plural and most arrogate the title. They form, in England, a
      magnificent collection, and if they abound in a quiet assumption of the
      grand style it must be owned that they frequently achieve it. There are
      people to be found who enjoy them, and it is not, at any rate, when Mr.
      Parsons deals with them that we have an opening for strictures. As we look
      at the blaze of full summer in the brilliantly conventional parterres we
      easily credit the tale of the 40,000 plants it takes to fill the beds.
      More than this, we like the long paths of turf that stretch between
      splendid borders, recalling the frescoed galleries of a palace; we like
      the immense hedges, whose tops are high against the sky. While we are
      liking, we like perhaps still better, since they deal with a very
      different order, the two water-colors from the dear little garden at
      Winchelsea&mdash;especially the one in which the lady takes he ease in her
      hammock (on a sociable, shady terrace, from which the ground drops), and
      looks at red Rye, across the marshes. Another garden where a contemplative
      hammock would be in order is the lovely canonical plot at Salisbury, with
      the everlasting spire above it tinted in the summer sky&mdash;unless, in
      the same place, you should choose to hook yourself up by the grassy bank
      of the Avon, at the end of the lawn, with the meadows, the cattle, the
      distant willows across the river, to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three admirable water-colors are devoted by Mr. Parsons to the perceptible
      dignity of Gravetye, in Sussex, the dignity of very serious gardens,
      entitled to ceremonious consideration, Few things in England can show a
      greater wealth of bloom than the wide flowery terrace immediately beneath
      the gray, gabled house, where tens of thousands of tea-roses, in
      predominant possession, have, in one direction, a mass of high yews for a
      background. They divide their province with the carnations and pansies: a
      wilder ness of tender petals ignorant of anything rougher than the
      neighborhood of the big unchanged medley of tall yuccas and saxifrage,
      with miscellaneous filling-in, in the picture which presents the charming
      house in profile. The artist shows us later, in September, at Gravetye,
      the pale violet multitude of the Michaelmas daisies; another I great
      bunch, or bank, of which half masks and greatly beautifies the rather bare
      yellow cottage at Broadway. This brings us on to the autumn, if I count as
      autumnal the admirable large water-color of a part of a garden at
      Shiplake, with the second bloom of the roses and a glimpse of a turn of
      the Thames. This exquisite picture expresses to perfection the beginning
      of the languor of the completed season&mdash;with its look of warm rest,
      of doing nothing, in the cloudless sky. To the same or a later moment
      belongs the straight walk at Fladbury&mdash;the old rectory garden by the
      Avon, with its Irish yews and the red lady in her chair; also the charming
      water-color of young, slim apple-trees, full of fruit (this must be
      October), beneath an admirable blue and white sky. Still later comes the
      big pear-tree that has turned, among barer boughs, to flame-color, and, in
      another picture, the very pale russet of the thinned cherry-trees,
      standing, beneath a grayish sky, above a foreshortened slope. Last of all
      we have, in oils, December and a hard frost in a bare apple-orchard,
      indented with a deep gully which makes the place somehow a subject and
      which, in fact, three or four years ago, made it one for a larger picture
      by Mr. Parsons, full of truth and style.
    </p>
    <p>
      This completes his charming story of the life of the English year, told in
      a way that convinces us of his intimate acquaintance with it. Half the
      interest of Mr. Parsons&rsquo; work is in the fact that he paints from a full
      mind and from a store of assimilated knowledge. In every touch of nature
      that he communicates to us we feel something of the thrill of the whole&mdash;we
      feel the innumerable relations, the possible variations of the particular
      objects. This makes his manner serious and masculine&mdash;rescues it from
      the thinness of tricks and the coquetries of <i>chic</i>. We walk with him
      on a firm earth, we taste the tone of the air and seem to take nature and
      the climate and all the complicated conditions by their big general hand.
      The painter&rsquo;s manner, in short, is one with the study of things&mdash;his
      talent is a part of their truth. In this happy series we seem to see still
      more how that talent was formed, how his rich motherland has been, from
      the earliest observation, its nurse and inspirer. He gives back to her all
      the good she has done him.

    <h2>
      JOHN S. SARGENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was on the point of beginning this sketch of the work of an artist to
      whom distinction has come very early in life by saying, in regard to the
      degree to which the subject of it enjoys the attention of the public, that
      no American painter has hitherto won himself such recognition from the
      expert; but I find myself pausing at the start as on the edge of a
      possible solecism. Is Mr. Sargent in very fact an American painter? The
      proper answer to such a question is doubtless that we shall be well
      advised to pretend it, and the reason of this is simply that we have an
      excellent opportunity. Born in Europe, he has also spent his life in
      Europe, but none the less the burden of proof would rest with those who
      should undertake to show that he is a European. Moreover he has even on
      the face of it this great symptom of an American origin, that in the line
      of his art he might easily be mistaken for a Frenchman. It sounds like a
      paradox, but it is a very simple truth, that when to-day we look for
      &ldquo;American art&rdquo; we find it mainly in Paris. When we find it out of Paris,
      we at least find a great deal of Paris in it. Mr. Sargent came up to the
      irresistible city in his twentieth year, from Florence, where in 1856 he
      had been born of American parents and where his fortunate youth had been
      spent. He entered immediately the studio of Caro-lus Duran, and revealed
      himself in 1877, at the age of twenty-two, in the portrait of that master&mdash;-a
      fine model in more than one sense of the word. He was already in
      possession of a style; and if this style has gained both in finish and in
      assurance, it has not otherwise varied. As he saw and &ldquo;rendered&rdquo; ten years
      ago, so he sees and renders to-day; and I may add that there is no present
      symptom of his passing into another manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have appreciated his work most up to the present time articulate
      no wish for a change, so completely does that work seem to them, in its
      kind, the exact translation of his thought, the exact &ldquo;fit&rdquo; of his
      artistic temperament. It is difficult to imagine a young painter less in
      the dark about his own ideal, more lucid and more responsible from the
      first about what he desires. In an altogether exceptional degree does he
      give us the sense that the intention and the art of carrying it out are
      for him one and the same thing. In the brilliant portrait of Carolus
      Duran, which he was speedily and strikingly to surpass, he gave almost the
      full measure of this admirable peculiarity, that perception with him is
      already by itself a kind of execution. It is likewise so, of course, with
      many another genuine painter; but in Sargent&rsquo;s case the process by which
      the object seen resolves itself into the object pictured is
      extraordinarily immediate. It is as if painting were pure tact of vision,
      a simple manner of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the time of his first successes at the Salon he was hailed, I
      believe, as a recruit of high value to the camp of the Impressionists, and
      to-day he is for many people most conveniently pigeon-holed under that
      head. It is not necessary to protest against the classification if this
      addition always be made to it, that Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s impressions happen to be
      worthy of record. This is by no means inveterately the case with those of
      the ingenuous artists who most rejoice in the title in question. To render
      the impression of an object may be a very fruitful effort, but it is not
      necessarily so; that will depend upon what, I won&rsquo;t say the object, but
      the impression, may have been. The talents engaged in this school lie, not
      unjustly, as it seems to me under the suspicion of seeking the solution of
      their problem exclusively in simplification. If a painter works for other
      eyes as well as his own he courts a certain danger in this direction&mdash;that
      of being arrested by the cry of the spectator: &ldquo;Ah! but excuse me; I
      myself take more impressions than that&rdquo; We feel a synthesis not to be an
      injustice only when it is rich. Mr. Sargent simplifies, I think, but he
      simplifies with style, and his impression is the finest form of his
      energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His work has been almost exclusively in portraiture, and it has been his
      fortune to paint more women than men; therefore he has had but a limited
      opportunity to reproduce that generalized grand air with which his view of
      certain figures of gentlemen invests the model, which is conspicuous in
      the portrait of Carolus Duran and of which his splendid &ldquo;Docteur Pozzi,&rdquo;
       the distinguished Paris surgeon (a work not sent to the Salon), is an
      admirable example. In each of these cases the model has been of a gallant
      pictorial type, one of the types which strike us as made for portraiture
      (which is by no means the way of all), as especially appears, for
      instance, in the handsome hands and frilled wrists of M. Carolus, whose
      cane rests in his fine fingers as if it were the hilt of a rapier. The
      most brilliant of all Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s productions is the portrait of a young
      lady, the magnificent picture which he exhibited in 1881; and if it has
      mainly been his fortune since to commemorate the fair faces of women,
      there is no ground for surprise at this sort of success on the part of one
      who had given so signal a proof of possessing the secret of the particular
      aspect that the contemporary lady (of any period) likes to wear in the
      eyes of posterity. Painted when he was but four-and-twenty years of age,
      the picture by which Mr. Sargent was represented at the Salon of 1881 is a
      performance which may well have made any critic of imagination rather
      anxious about his future. In common with the superb group of the children
      of Mr. Edward Boit, exhibited two years later, it offers the slightly
      &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; spectacle of a talent which on the very threshold of its career
      has nothing more to learn. It is not simply precocity in the guise of
      maturity&mdash;a phenomenon we very often meet, which deceives us only for
      an hour; it is the freshness of youth combined with the artistic
      experience, really felt and assimilated, of generations. My admiration for
      this deeply distinguished work is such that I am perhaps in danger of
      overstating its merits; but it is worth taking into account that to-day,
      after several years&rsquo; acquaintance with them, these merits seem to me more
      and more to justify enthusiasm. The picture has this sign of productions
      of the first order, that its style clearly would save it if everything
      else should change&mdash;our measure of its value of resemblance, its
      expression of character, the fashion of dress, the particular associations
      it evokes. It is not only a portrait, but a picture, and it arouses even
      in the profane spectator something of the painter&rsquo;s sense, the joy of
      engaging also, by sympathy, in the solution of the artistic problem. There
      are works of which it is sometimes said that they are painters&rsquo; pictures
      (this description is apt to be intended invidiously), and the production
      of which I speak has the good-fortune at once to belong to this class and
      to give the &ldquo;plain man&rdquo; the kind of pleasure that the plain man looks for.

      The young lady, dressed in black satin, stands upright, with her right
      hand bent back, resting on her waist, while the other, with the arm
      somewhat extended, offers to view a single white flower. The dress.
      stretched at the hips over a sort of hoop, and ornamented in front, where
      it opens on a velvet petticoat with large satin bows, has an old-fashioned
      air, as if it had been worn by some demure princess who might have sat for
      Velasquez. The hair, of which the arrangement is odd and charming, is
      disposed in two or three large curls fastened at one side over the temple
      with a comb. Behind the figure is the vague faded sheen, exquisite in
      tone, of a silk curtain, light, undefined, and losing itself at the
      bottom. The face is young, candid and peculiar. Out of these few elements
      the artist has constructed a picture which it is impossible to forget, of
      which the most striking characteristic is its simplicity, and yet which
      overflows with perfection. Painted with extraordinary breadth and freedom,
      so that surface and texture are interpreted by the lightest hand, it glows
      with life, character and distinction, and strikes us as the most complete&mdash;with
      one exception perhaps&mdash;of the author&rsquo;s productions. I know not why
      this representation of a young girl in black, engaged in the casual
      gesture of holding up a flower, should make so ineffaceable an impression
      and tempt one to become almost lyrical in its praise; but I remember that,
      encountering the picture unexpectedly in New York a year or two after it
      had been exhibited in Paris, it seemed to me to have acquired an
      extraordinary general value, to stand for more artistic truth than it
      would be easy to formulate. The language of painting, the tongue in which,
      exclusively, Mr. Sargent expresses himself, is a medium into which a
      considerable part of the public, for the simple an excellent reason that
      they don&rsquo;t understand it, will doubtless always be reluctant and unable to
      follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years before he exhibited the young lady in black, in 1879, Mr.
      Sargent had spent several months in Spain, and here, even more than he had
      already been, the great Velasquez became the god of his idolatry. No
      scenes are more delightful to the imagination than those in which we
      figure youth and genius confronted with great examples, and if such
      matters did not belong to the domain of private life we might entertain
      ourselves with reconstructing the episode of the first visit to the museum
      of Madrid, the shrine of the painter of Philip IV., of a young
      Franco-American worshipper of the highest artistic sensibility, expecting
      a supreme revelation and prepared to fall on his knees. It is evident that
      Mr. Sargent fell on his knees and that in this attitude he passed a
      considerable part of his sojourn in Spain. He is various and experimental;
      if I am not mistaken, he sees each work that he produces in a light of its
      own, not turning off successive portraits according to some well-tried
      receipt which has proved useful in the case of their predecessors;
      nevertheless there is one idea that pervades them all, in a different
      degree, and gives them a family resemblance&mdash;the idea that it would
      be inspiring to know just how Velasquez would have treated the theme. We
      can fancy that on each occasion Mr. Sargent, as a solemn preliminary,
      invokes him as a patron saint. This is not, in my intention, tantamount to
      saying that the large canvas representing the contortions of a dancer in
      the lamp-lit room of a <i>posada</i>, which he exhibited on his return
      from Spain, strikes me as having come into the world under the same star
      as those compositions of the great Spaniard which at Madrid alternate with
      his royal portraits. This singular work, which has found an appreciative
      home in Boston, has the stamp of an extraordinary energy and facility&mdash;of
      an actual scene, with its accidents and peculiarities caught, as
      distinguished from a composition where arrangement and invention have
      played their part. It looks like life, but it looks also, to my view,
      rather like a perversion of life, and has the quality of an enormous
      &ldquo;note&rdquo; or memorandum, rather than of a representation. A woman in a
      voluminous white silk dress and a black mantilla pirouettes in the middle
      of a dusky room, to the accompaniment of her own castanets and that of a
      row of men and women who sit in straw chairs against the whitewashed wall
      and thrum upon guitar and tambourine or lift other castanets into the air.
      She appears almost colossal, and the twisted and inflated folds of her
      long dress increase her volume. She simpers, in profile, with a long chin,
      while she slants back at a dangerous angle, and the lamplight (it proceeds
      from below, as if she were on a big platform) makes a strange play in her
      large face. In the background the straight line of black-clad,
      black-hatted, white-shirted musicians projects shadows against the wall,
      on which placards, guitars, and dirty finger-marks display themselves. The
      merit of this production is that the air of reality is given in it with
      remarkable breadth and boldness; its defect it is difficult to express
      save by saying that it makes the spectator vaguely uneasy and even unhappy&mdash;an
      accident the more to be regretted as a lithe, inspired female figure,
      given up to the emotion of the dance, is not intrinsically a displeasing
      object. &ldquo;El Jaleo&rdquo; sins, in my opinion, in the direction of ugliness, and,
      independently of the fact that the heroine is circling round incommoded by
      her petticoats, has a want of serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the defect of the charming, dusky, white-robed person who, in
      the Tangerine subject exhibited at the Salon of 1880 (the fruit of an
      excursion to the African coast at the time of the artist&rsquo;s visit to
      Spain), stands on a rug, under a great white Moorish arch, and from out of
      the shadows of the large drapery, raised pentwise by her hands, which
      covers her head, looks down, with painted eyes and brows showing above a
      bandaged mouth, at the fumes of a beautiful censer or chafing-dish placed
      on the carpet. I know not who this stately Mahometan may be, nor in what
      mysterious domestic or religious rite she may be engaged; but in her
      muffled contemplation and her pearl-colored robes, under her plastered
      arcade which shines in the Eastern light, she transports and torments us.
      The picture is exquisite, a radiant effect of white upon white, of similar
      but discriminated tones. In dividing the honor that Mr. Sargent has won by
      his finest work between the portrait of the young lady of 1881 and the
      group of four little girls which was painted in 1882 and exhibited with
      the success it deserved the following year, I must be careful to give the
      latter picture not too small a share. The artist has done nothing more
      felicitous and interesting than this view of a rich dim, rather
      generalized French interior (the perspective of a hall with a shining
      floor, where screens and tall Japanese vases shimmer and loom), which
      encloses the life and seems to form the happy play-world of a family of
      charming children. The treatment is eminently unconventional, and there is
      none of the usual symmetrical balancing of the figures in the foreground.
      The place is regarded as a whole; it is a scene, a comprehensive
      impression; yet none the less do the little figures in their white
      pinafores (when was the pinafore ever painted with that power and made so
      poetic?) detach themselves and live with a personal life. Two of the
      sisters stand hand in hand at the back, in the delightful, the almost
      equal, company of a pair of immensely tall emblazoned jars, which overtop
      them and seem also to partake of the life of the picture; the splendid
      porcelain and the aprons of the children shine together, while a mirror in
      the brown depth behind them catches the light. Another little girl
      presents herself, with abundant tresses and slim legs, her hands behind
      her, quite to the left; and the youngest, nearest to the spectator, sits
      on the floor and plays with her doll. The naturalness of the composition,
      the loveliness of the complete effect, the light, free&rsquo; security of the
      execution, the sense it gives us as of assimilated secrets and of instinct
      and knowledge playing together&mdash;all this makes the picture as
      astonishing a work on the part of a young man of twenty-six as the
      portrait of 1881 was astonishing on the part of a young man of
      twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is these remarkable encounters that justify us in writing almost
      prematurely of a career which is not yet half unfolded. Mr. Sargent is
      sometimes accused of a want of &ldquo;finish,&rdquo; but if finish means the last word
      of expressiveness of touch, &ldquo;The Hall with the Four Children,&rdquo; as we may
      call it, may-stand as a permanent reference on this point. If the picture
      of the Spanish dancer illustrates, as it seems to me to do, the latent
      dangers of the Impressionist practice, so this finer performance shows
      what victories it may achieve. And in relation to the latter I must repeat
      what I said about the young lady with the flower, that this is the sort of
      work which, when produced in youth, leads the attentive spectator to ask
      unanswerable questions. He finds himself murmuring, &ldquo;Yes, but what is
      left?&rdquo; and even wondering whether it be an advantage to an artist to
      obtain early in life such possession of his means that the struggle with
      them, discipline, <i>tâtonnement</i>, cease to exist for him. May not this
      breed an irresponsibility of cleverness, a wantonness, an irreverence&mdash;what
      is vulgarly termed a &ldquo;larkiness&rdquo;&mdash;on the part of the youthful genius
      who has, as it were, all his fortune in his pocket? Such are the possibly
      superfluous broodings of those who are critical even in their warmest
      admirations and who sometimes suspect that it may be better for an artist
      to have a certain part of his property invested in unsolved difficulties.
      When this is not the case, the question with regard to his future
      simplifies itself somewhat portentously. &ldquo;What will he do with it?&rdquo; we
      ask, meaning by the pronoun the sharp, completely forged weapon. It
      becomes more purely a question of responsibility, and we hold him
      altogether to a higher account. This is the case with Mr. Sargent; he
      knows so much about the art of painting that he perhaps does not fear
      emergencies quite enough, and that having knowledge to spare he may be
      tempted to play with it and waste it. Various, curious, as we have called
      him, he occasionally tries experiments which seem to arise from the mere
      high spirits of his brush, and runs risks little courted by the votaries
      of the literal, who never expose their necks to escape from the common.
      For the literal and the common he has the smallest taste; when he renders
      an object into the language of painting his translation is a generous
      paraphrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have intimated, he has painted little but portraits; but he has
      painted very many of these, and I shall not attempt in so few pages to
      give a catalogue of his works. Every canvas that has come from his hands
      has not figured at the Salon; some of them have seen the light at other
      exhibitions in Paris; some of them in London (of which city Mr. Sargent is
      now an inhabitant), at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery. If he
      has been mainly represented by portraits there are two or three little
      subject-pictures of which I retain a grateful memory. There stands out in
      particular, as a pure gem, a small picture exhibited at the Grosvenor,
      representing a small group of Venetian girls of the lower class, sitting
      in gossip together one summer&rsquo;s day in the big, dim hall of a shabby old
      palazzo. The shutters let in a clink of light; the scagliola pavement
      gleams faintly in it; the whole place is bathed in a kind of transparent
      shade. The girls are vaguely engaged in some very humble household work;
      they are counting turnips or stringing onions, and these small vegetables,
      enchantingly painted, look as valuable as magnified pearls. The figures
      are extraordinarily natural and vivid; wonderfully light and fine is the
      touch by which the painter evokes the small familiar Venetian realities
      (he has handled them with a vigor altogether peculiar in various other
      studies which I have not space to enumerate), and keeps the whole thing
      free from that element of humbug which has ever attended most attempts to
      reproduce the idiosyncrasies of Italy. I am, however, drawing to the end
      of my remarks without having mentioned a dozen of those brilliant triumphs
      in the field of portraiture with which Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s name is
      preponderantly associated. I jumped from his &ldquo;Carolus Duran&rdquo; to the
      masterpiece of 1881 without speaking of the charming &ldquo;Madame Pailleron&rdquo; of
      1879, or the picture of this lady&rsquo;s children the following year. Many, or
      rather most, of Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s sitters have been French, and he has studied
      the physiognomy of this nation so attentively that a little of it perhaps
      remains in the brush with which to-day, more than in his first years, he
      represents other types. I have alluded to his superb &ldquo;Docteur Pozzi,&rdquo; to
      whose very handsome, still youthful head and slightly artificial posture
      he has given so fine a French cast that he might be excused if he should,
      even on remoter pretexts, find himself reverting to it. This gentleman
      stands up in his brilliant red dressing-gown with the <i>prestance</i> of
      a princely Vandyck. I should like to commemorate the portrait of a lady of
      a certain age and of an equally certain interest of appearance&mdash;a
      lady in black, with black hair, a black hat and a vast feather, which was
      displayed at that entertaining little annual exhibition of the
      &ldquo;Mirlitons,&rdquo; in the Place Vendôme. With the exquisite modelling of its
      face (no one better than Mr. Sargent understands the beauty that resides
      in exceeding fineness), this head remains in my mind as a masterly
      rendering of the look of experience&mdash;such experience as may be
      attributed to a woman slightly faded and eminently distinguished. Subject
      and treatment in this valuable piece are of an equal interest, and in the
      latter there is an element of positive sympathy which is not always in a
      high degree the sign of Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s work. What shall I say of the
      remarkable canvas which, on the occasion of the Salon of 1884, brought the
      critics about our artist&rsquo;s ears, the already celebrated portrait of
      &ldquo;Madame G.?&rdquo; It is an experiment of a highly original kind, and the
      painter has had in the case, in regard to what Mr. Ruskin would call the
      &ldquo;rightness&rdquo; of his attempt, the courage of his opinion. A contestable
      beauty, according to Parisian fame, the lady stands upright beside a table
      on which her right arm rests, with her body almost fronting the spectator
      and her face in complete profile. She wears an entirely sleeveless dress
      of black satin, against which her admirable left arm detaches itself; the
      line of her harmonious profile has a sharpness which Mr. Sargent does not
      always seek, and the crescent of Diana, an ornament in diamonds, rests on
      her singular head. This work had not the good-fortune to please the public
      at large, and I believe it even excited a kind of unreasoned scandal&mdash;an
      idea sufficiently amusing in the light of some of the manifestations of
      the plastic effort to which, each year, the Salon stands sponsor. This
      superb picture, noble in conception and masterly in line, gives to the
      figure represented something of the high relief of the profiled images on
      great friezes. It is a work to take or to leave, as the phrase is, and one
      in regard to which the question of liking or disliking comes promptly to
      be settled. The author has never gone further in being boldly and
      consistently himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of Mr. Sargent&rsquo;s recent productions have been portraits of American
      ladies whom it must have been a delight to paint; I allude to those of
      Lady Playfair and Mrs. Henry White, both of which were seen in the Royal
      Academy of 1885, and the former subsequently in Boston, where it abides.
      These things possess, largely, the quality which makes Mr. Sargent so
      happy as a painter of women&mdash;a quality which can best be expressed by
      a reference to what it is not, to the curiously literal, prosaic, sexless
      treatment to which, in the commonplace work that looks down at us from the
      walls of almost all exhibitions, delicate feminine elements have evidently
      so often been sacrificed. Mr. Sargent handles these elements with a
      special feeling for them, and they borrow a kind of noble intensity from
      his brush. This intensity is not absent from the two portraits I just
      mentioned, that of Lady Playfair and that of Mrs. Henry White; it looks
      out at us from the erect head and frank animation of the one, and the
      silvery sheen and shimmer of white satin and white lace which form the
      setting of the slim tall-ness of the other. In the Royal Academy of 1886
      Mr. Sargent was represented by three important canvases, all of which
      reminded the spectator of how much the brilliant effect he produces in an
      English exhibition arises from a certain appearance that he has of looking
      down from a height, a height of cleverness, a sensible giddiness of
      facility, at the artistic problems of the given case. Sometimes there is
      even a slight impertinence in it; that, doubtless, was the impression of
      many of the people who passed, staring, with an ejaculation, before the
      triumphant group of the three Misses V. These young ladies, seated in a
      row, with a room much foreshortened for a background, and treated with a
      certain familiarity of frankness, excited in London a chorus of murmurs
      not dissimilar to that which it had been the fortune of the portrait
      exhibited in 1884 to elicit in Paris, and had the further privilege of
      drawing forth some prodigies of purblind criticism. Works of this
      character are a genuine service; after the short-lived gibes of the
      profane have subsided, they are found to have cleared the air. They remind
      people that the faculty of taking a direct, independent, unborrowed
      impression is not altogether lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this very rapid review I have accompanied Mr. Sargent to a very recent
      date. If I have said that observers encumbered with a nervous temperament
      may at any moment have been anxious about his future, I have it on my
      conscience to add that the day has not yet come for a complete extinction
      of this anxiety. Mr. Sargent is so young, in spite of the place allotted
      to him in these pages, so often a record of long careers and uncontested
      triumphs that, in spite also of the admirable works he has already
      produced, his future is the most valuable thing he has to show. We may
      still ask ourselves what he will do with it, while we indulge the hope
      that he will see fit to give successors to the two pictures which I have
      spoken of emphatically as his finest. There is no greater work of art than
      a great portrait&mdash;a truth to be constantly taken to heart by a
      painter holding in his hands the weapon that Mr. Sargent wields. The gift
      that he possesses he possesses completely&mdash;the immediate perception
      of the end and of the means. Putting aside the question of the subject
      (and to a great portrait a common sitter will doubtless not always
      contribute), the highest result is achieved when to this element of quick
      perception a certain faculty of brooding reflection is added. I use this
      name for want of a better, and I mean the quality in the light of which
      the artist sees deep into his subject, undergoes it, absorbs it, discovers
      in it new things that were not on the surface, becomes patient with it,
      and almost reverent, and, in short, enlarges and humanizes the technical
      problem.

    <h2>
      HONORÉ DAUMIER
    </h2>
    <p>
      AS we attempt, at the present day, to write the history of everything, it
      would be strange if we had happened to neglect the annals of caricature;
      for the very essence of the art of Cruikshank and Gavarni, of Daumier and
      Leech, is to be historical; and every one knows how addicted is this great
      science to discoursing about itself. Many industrious seekers, in England
      and France, have ascended the stream of time to the source of the modern
      movement of pictorial satire. The stream of time is in this case mainly
      the stream of journalism; for social and political caricature, as the
      present century has practised it, is only journalism made doubly vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject indeed is a large one, if we reflect upon it, for many people
      would tell us that journalism is the greatest invention of our age. If
      this rich affluent has shared the great fortune of the general torrent,
      so, on other sides, it touches the fine arts, touches manners, touches
      morals. All this helps to account for its inexhaustible life; journalism
      is the criticism of the moment <i>at</i> the moment, and caricature is
      that criticism at once simplified and intensified by a plastic form. We
      know the satiric image as periodical, and above all as punctual&mdash;the
      characteristics of the printed sheet with which custom has at last
      inveterately associated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, by-the-way, makes us wonder considerably at the failure of
      caricature to achieve, as yet, a high destiny in America&mdash;a failure
      which might supply an occasion for much explanatory discourse, much
      searching of the relations of things. The newspaper has been taught to
      flourish among us as it flourishes nowhere else, and to flourish moreover
      on a humorous and irreverent basis; yet it has never taken to itself this
      helpful concomitant of an unscrupulous spirit and a quick periodicity. The
      explanation is probably that it needs an old society to produce ripe
      caricature. The newspaper thrives in the United States, but journalism
      languishes; for the lively propagation of news is one thing and the large
      interpretation of it is another. A society has to be old before it becomes
      critical, and it has to become critical before it can take pleasure in the
      reproduction of its incongruities by an instrument as impertinent as the
      indefatigable crayon. Irony, scepticism, pessimism are, in any particular
      soil, plants of gradual growth, and it is in the art of caricature that
      they flower most aggressively. Furthermore they must be watered by
      education&mdash;I mean by the education of the eye and hand&mdash;all of
      which things take time. The soil must be rich too, the incongruities must
      swarm. It is open to doubt whether a pure democracy is very liable to make
      this particular satiric return upon itself; for which it would seem tha&rsquo; 
      certain social complications are indispensable. These complications are
      supplied from the moment a democracy becomes, as we may say, impure from
      its own point of view; from the moment variations and heresies, deviations
      or perhaps simple affirmations of taste and temper begin to multiply
      within it. Such things afford a <i>point d&rsquo;appui</i>; for it is evidently
      of the essence of caricature to be reactionary. We hasten to add that its
      satiric force varies immensely in kind and in degree according to the
      race, or to the individual talent, that takes advantage of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used just now the term pessimism; but that was doubtless in a great
      measure because I have been turning over a collection of the
      extraordinarily vivid drawings of Honoré Daumier. The same impression
      would remain with me, no doubt, if I had been consulting an equal quantity
      of the work of Gavarni the wittiest, the most literary and most acutely
      profane of all chartered mockers with the pencil. The feeling of
      disrespect abides in all these things, the expression of the spirit for
      which humanity is definable primarily by its weaknesses. For Daumier these
      weaknesses are altogether ugly and grotesque, while for Gavarni they are
      either basely graceful or touchingly miserable; but the vision of them in
      both cases is close and direct. If, on the other hand, we look through a
      dozen volumes of the collection of <i>Punch</i> we get an equal impression
      of hilarity, but we by no means get an equal impression of irony.
      Certainly the pages of <i>Punch</i> do not reek with pessimism; their
      &ldquo;criticism of life&rdquo; is gentle and forbearing. Leech is positively
      optimistic; there is at any rate nothing infinite in his irreverence; it
      touches bottom as soon as it approaches the pretty woman or the nice girl.
      It is such an apparition as this that really, in Gavarni, awakes the
      scoffer. Du Maurier is as graceful as Gavarni, but his sense of beauty
      conjures away almost everything save our minor vices. It is in the
      exploration of our major ones that Gavarni makes his principal discoveries
      of charm or of absurdity of attitude. None the less, of course, the
      general inspiration of both artists is the same: the desire to try the
      innumerable different ways in which the human subject may <i>not</i> be
      taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this view of that subject, in its plastic manifestations, makes history
      of a sort, it will not in general be of a kind to convert those persons
      who find history sad reading. The writer of the present lines remained
      unconverted, lately, on an occasion on which many cheerful influences were
      mingled with his impression. They were of a nature to which he usually
      does full justice, even overestimating perhaps their charm of suggestion;
      but, at the hour I speak of, the old Parisian quay, the belittered
      print-shop, the pleasant afternoon, the glimpse of the great Louvre on the
      other side of the Seine, in the interstices of the sallow <i>estampes</i>
      suspended in window and doorway&mdash;all these elements of a rich
      actuality availed only to mitigate, without transmuting, that general
      vision of a high, cruel pillory which pieced itself together as I drew
      specimen after specimen from musty portfolios. I had been passing the shop
      when I noticed in a small <i>vitrine</i>, let into the embrasure of the
      doorway, half a dozen soiled, striking lithographs, which it took no more
      than a first glance to recognize as the work of Daumier. They were only
      old pages of the <i>Charivari</i>, torn away from the text and rescued
      from the injury of time; and they were accompanied with an inscription to
      the effect that many similar examples of the artist were to be seen
      within. To become aware of this circumstance was to enter the shop and to
      find myself promptly surrounded with bulging; <i>cartons</i> and tattered
      relics. These relics&mdash;crumpled leaves of the old comic journals of
      the period from 1830 to 1855&mdash;are neither rare nor expensive; but I
      happened to have lighted on a particularly copious collection, and I made
      the most of my small good-fortune, in order to transmute it, if possible,
      into a sort of compensation for my having missed unavoidably, a few months
      before, the curious exhibition &ldquo;de la Caricature Moderne&rdquo; held for several
      weeks just at hand, in the École des Beaux-Arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daumier was said to have appeared there in considerable force; and it was
      a loss not to have had that particular opportunity of filling one&rsquo;s mind
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was perhaps a perversity in having wished to do so, strange,
      indigestible stuff of contemplation as he might appear to be; but the
      perversity had had an honorable growth. Daumier&rsquo;s great days were in the
      reign of Louis-Philippe; but in the early years of the Second Empire he
      still plied his coarse and formidable pencil. I recalled, from a juvenile
      consciousness, the last failing strokes of it. They used to impress me in
      Paris, as a child, with their abnormal blackness as well as with their
      grotesque, magnifying movement, and there was something in them that
      rather scared a very immature admirer. This small personage, however, was
      able to perceive later, when he was unfortunately deprived of the chance
      of studying them, that there were various things in them besides the power
      to excite a vague alarm. Daumier was perhaps a great artist; at all events
      unsatisfied curiosity increased in proportion to that possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first complete satisfaction of it was really in the long hours that I
      spent in the little shop on the quay. There I filled my mind with him, and
      there too, at no great cost, I could make a big parcel of these cheap
      reproductions of his work. This work had been shown in the Ecole des
      Beaux-Arts as it came from his hand; M. Champfleury, his biographer, his
      cataloguer and devotee, having poured forth the treasures of a precious
      collection, as I suppose they would be called in the case of an artist of
      higher flights. It was only as he was seen by the readers of the comic
      journals of his day that I could now see him; but I tried to make up for
      my want of privilege by prolonged immersion. I was not able to take home
      all the portfolios from the shop on the quay, but I took home what I
      could, and I went again to turn over the superannuated piles. I liked
      looking at them on the spot; I seemed still surrounded by the artist&rsquo;s
      vanished Paris and his extinct Parisians. Indeed no quarter of the
      delightful city probably shows, on the whole, fewer changes from the
      aspect it wore during the period of Louis-Philippe, the time when it will
      ever appear to many of its friends to have been most delightful. The long
      line of the quay is unaltered, and the rare charm of the river. People
      came and went in the shop: it is a wonder how many, in the course of an
      hour, may lift the latch even of an establishment that pretends to no
      great business. What was all this small, sociable, contentious life but
      the great Daumier&rsquo;s subject-matter? He was the painter of the Parisian
      bourgeois, and the voice of the bourgeois was in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Champfleury has given a summary of Daumier&rsquo;s career in his smart little
      <i>Histoire e la Caricature Moderne</i>, a record not at all abundant in
      personal detail. The biographer has told his story better perhaps in his
      careful catalogue of the artist&rsquo;s productions, the first sketch of which
      is to be found in <i>L&rsquo;Art</i> for 1878. This copious list is Daumier&rsquo;s
      real history; his life cannot have been a very different business from his
      work. I read in the interesting publication of M. Grand-Carteret (<i>Les
      Moeurs et la Caricature en France</i> 1888) that our artist produced
      nearly 4000 lithographs and a thousand drawings on wood, up to the time
      when failure of eyesight compelled him to rest. This is not the sort of
      activity that leaves a man much time for independent adventures, and
      Daumier was essentially of the type, common in France, of the specialist
      so immersed in his specialty that he can be painted in only one attitude&mdash;a
      general circumstance which perhaps helps to account for the paucity, in
      that country, of biography, in our English sense of the word, in
      proportion to the superabundance of criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honoré Daumier was born at Marseilles February 26th, 1808; he died on the
      11th of the same month, 1879. His main activity, however, was confined to
      the earlier portion of a career of almost exactly seventy-one years, and I
      find it affirmed in Vapereau&rsquo;s <i>Dictionnaire des Contemporains</i> that
      he became completely blind between 1850 and 1860. He enjoyed a pension
      from the State of 2400 francs; but what relief from misery could mitigate
      a quarter of a century of darkness for a man who had looked out at the
      world with such vivifying eyes? His father had followed the trade of a
      glazier, but was otherwise vocal than in the emission of the rich
      street-cry with which we used all to be familiar, and which has vanished
      with so many other friendly pedestrian notes. The elder Daumier wrought
      verses as well as window-panes, and M. Champfleury has disinterred a small
      volume published by him in 1823. The merit of his poetry is not striking;
      but he was able to transmit the artistic nature to his son, who, becoming
      promptly conscious of it, made the inevitable journey to Paris in search
      of fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young draughtsman appeared to have missed at first the way to this
      boon; inasmuch as in the year 1832 he found himself condemned to six
      months&rsquo; imprisonment for a lithograph disrespectful to Louis-Philippe.
      This drawing had appeared in the <i>Caricature</i>, an organ of pictorial
      satire founded in those days by one Philipon, with the aid of a band of
      young mockers to whom he gave ideas and a direction, and several others,
      of whom Gavarni, Henry Monnier, Decamps, Grandville, were destined to make
      themselves a place. M. Eugène Montrosier, in a highly appreciative article
      on Daumier in <i>L&rsquo;Art</i> for 1878, says that this same Philipon was <i>le
      journalisme fait homme</i>; which did not prevent him&mdash;rather in fact
      fostered such a result&mdash;from being perpetually in delicate relations
      with the government. He had had many horses killed under him, and had led
      a life of attacks, penalties, suppressions and resurrections. He
      subsequently established the <i>Charivari</i> and launched a publication
      entitled <i>L&rsquo;Association Lithographique Mensuelle</i>, which brought to
      light much of Daumier&rsquo;s early work. The artist passed rapidly from seeking
      his way to finding it, and from an ineffectual to a vigorous form.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this limited compass and in the case of such a quantity of production
      it is almost impossible to specify&mdash;difficult to pick dozens of
      examples out of thousands. Daumier became more and more the political
      spirit of the <i>Charivari</i>, or at least the political pencil, for M.
      Philipon, the breath of whose nostrils was opposition&mdash;one perceives
      from here the little bilious, bristling, ingenious, insistent man&mdash;is
      to be credited with a suggestive share in any enterprise in which he had a
      hand. This pencil played over public life, over the sovereign, the
      ministers, the deputies, the peers, the judiciary, the men and the
      measures, the reputations and scandals of the moment, with a strange,
      ugly, extravagant, but none the less sane and manly vigor. Daumier&rsquo;s sign
      is strength above all, and in turning over his pages to-day there is no
      intensity of force that the careful observer will not concede to him. It
      is perhaps another matter to assent to the proposition, put forth by his
      greatest admirers among his countrymen, that he is the first of all
      caricaturists. To the writer of this imperfect sketch he remains
      considerably less interesting than Gavarni; and/or a particular reason,
      which it is difficult to express otherwise than by saying that he is too
      simple. Simplicity was not Gavarni&rsquo;s fault, and indeed to a large degree
      it was Daumier&rsquo;s merit. The single grossly ridiculous or almost hauntingly
      characteristic thing which his figures represent is largely the reason why
      they still represent life and an unlucky reality years after the names
      attached to them have parted with a vivifying power. Such vagueness has
      overtaken them, for the most part, and to such a thin reverberation have
      they shrunk, the persons and the affairs which were then so intensely
      sketchable. Daumier handled them with a want of ceremony which would have
      been brutal were it not for the element of science in his work, making
      them immense and unmistakable in their drollery, or at least in their
      grotesqueness; for the term drollery suggests gayety, and Daumier is
      anything but gay. <i>Un rude peintre de moeurs</i>, M. Champfleury calls
      him; and the phrase expresses his extreme breadth of treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the victims of his &ldquo;rudeness&rdquo; M. Thiers is almost the only one whom the
      present generation may recognize without a good deal of reminding, and
      indeed his hand is relatively light in delineating this personage of few
      inches and many episodes. M. Thiers must have been dear to the
      caricaturist, for he belonged to the type that was easy to &ldquo;do;&rdquo; it being
      well known that these gentlemen appreciate public characters in direct
      proportion to their saliency of feature. When faces are reducible to a few
      telling strokes their wearers are overwhelmed with the honors of
      publicity; with which, on the other hand, nothing is more likely to
      interfere than the possession of a countenance neatly classical. Daumier
      had only to give M. Thiers the face of a clever owl, and the trick was
      played. Of course skill was needed to individualize the symbol, but that
      is what caricaturists propose to themselves. Of how well he succeeded the
      admirable plate of the lively little minister in a &ldquo;new dress&rdquo;&mdash;tricked
      out in the uniform of a general of the First Republic&mdash;is a
      sufficient illustration. The bird of night is not an acute bird, but how
      the artist has presented the image of a selected specimen! And with what a
      life-giving pencil the whole figure is put on its feet, what intelligent
      drawing, what a rich, free stroke! The allusions conveyed in it are to
      such forgotten things that it is strange to think the personage was, only
      the other year, still contemporaneous; that he might have been met, on a
      fine day, taking a few firm steps in a quiet part of the Champs Élysées,
      with his footman carrying a second overcoat and looking doubly tall behind
      him. In whatever attitude Daumier depicts him, planted as a tiny
      boxing-master at the feet of the virtuous colossus in a blouse (whose legs
      are apart, like those-of the Rhodian), in whom the artist represents the
      People, to watch the match that is about to come off between Ratapoil and
      M. Berryer, or even in the act of lifting the &ldquo;parricidal&rdquo; club of a new
      repressive law to deal a blow at the Press, an effulgent, diligent,
      sedentary muse (this picture, by the way, is a perfect specimen of the
      simple and telling in political caricature)&mdash;however, as I say, he
      takes M. Thiers, there is always a rough indulgence in his crayon, as if
      he were grateful to him for lending himself so well. He invented Ratapoil
      as he appropriated Robert Macaire, and as a caricaturist he never fails to
      put into circulation, when he can, a character to whom he may attribute as
      many as possible of the affectations or the vices of the day. Robert
      Macaire, an imaginative, a romantic rascal, was the hero of a highly
      successful melodrama written for Frederick Lemaitre; but Daumier made him
      the type of the swindler at large in an age of feverish speculation&mdash;the
      projector of showy companies, the advertiser of worthless shares. There is
      a whole series of drawings descriptive of his exploits, a hundred masterly
      plates which, according to M. Champfleury, consecrated Daumier&rsquo;s
      reputation. The subject, the legend, was in most cases, still according to
      M. Champfleury, suggested by Philipon. Sometimes it was very witty; as for
      instance when Bertrand, the muddled acolyte or scraping second fiddle of
      the hero, objects, in relation to a brilliant scheme which he has just
      developed, with the part Bertrand is to play, that there are constables in
      the country, and he promptly replies, &ldquo;Constables? So much the better&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      take the shares!&rdquo; Ratapoil was an evocation of the same general character,
      but with a difference of <i>nuance</i>&mdash;the ragged political bully,
      or hand-to-mouth demagogue, with the smashed tall hat, cocked to one side,
      the absence of linen, the club half-way up his sleeve, the swagger and
      pose of being gallant for the people. Ratapoil abounds in the promiscuous
      drawings that I have looked over, and is always very strong and living,
      with a considerable element of the sinister, so often in Daumier an
      accompaniment of the comic. There is an admirable page&mdash;it brings the
      idea down to 1851&mdash;in which a sordid but astute peasant, twirling his
      thumbs on his stomach and looking askance, allows this political adviser
      to urge upon him in a whisper that there is not a minute to lose&mdash;to
      lose for action, of course&mdash;if he wishes to keep his wife, his house,
      his field, his heifer and his calf. The canny scepticism in the ugly,
      half-averted face of the typical rustic who considerably suspects his
      counsellor is indicated by a few masterly strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what the student of Daumier recognizes as his science, or, if the
      word has a better grace, his art. It is what has kept life in his work so
      long after so many of the occasions of it have been swept into darkness.
      Indeed, there is no such commentary on renown as the &ldquo;back numbers&rdquo; of a
      comic journal. They show us that at certain moments certain people were
      eminent, only to make us unsuccessfully try to remember what they were
      eminent <i>for</i>. And the comparative obscurity (comparative, I mean, to
      the talent of the caricaturist) overtakes even the most justly honored
      names. M. Berryer was a splendid speaker and a public servant of real
      distinction and the highest utility; yet the fact that to-day his name is
      on few men&rsquo;s lips seems to be emphasized by this other fact that we
      continue to pore over Daumier, in whose plates we happen to come across
      him. It reminds one afresh how Art is an embalmer, a magician, whom we can
      never speak too fair. People duly impressed with this truth are sometimes
      laughed at for their superstitious tone, which is pronounced, according to
      the fancy of the critic, mawkish, maudlin or hysterical. But it is really
      difficult to see how any reiteration of the importance of art can
      overstate the plain facts. It prolongs, it preserves, it consecrates, it
      raises from the dead. It conciliates, charms, bribes posterity; and it
      murmurs to mortals, as the old French poet sang to his mistress, &ldquo;You will
      be fair only so far as I have said so.&rdquo; When it whispers even to the
      great, &ldquo;You depend upon me, and I can do more for you, in the long-run,
      than any one else,&rdquo; it is scarcely too proud. It puts method and power and
      the strange, real, mingled air of things into Daumier&rsquo;s black sketchiness,
      so full of the technical <i>gras</i>, the &ldquo;fat&rdquo; which French critics
      commend and which we have no word to express. It puts power above all, and
      the effect which he best achieves, that of a certain simplification of the
      attitude or the gesture to an almost symbolic generality. His persons
      represent only one thing, but they insist tremendously on that, and their
      expression of it abides with us, unaccompanied with timid detail. It may
      really be said that they represent only one class&mdash;the old and ugly;
      so that there is proof enough of a special faculty in his having played
      such a concert, lugubrious though it be, on a single chord. It has been
      made a reproach to him, says M. Grand-Carteret, that &ldquo;his work is lacking
      in two capital elements&mdash;<i>la jeunesse et la femme</i>;&rdquo; and the
      commentator resents his being made to suffer for the deficiency&mdash;&ldquo;as
      if an artist could be at the same time deep, comic, graceful and pretty;
      as if all those who have a real value had not created for themselves a
      form to which they remain confined and a type which they reproduce in all
      its variations, as soon as they have touched the æsthetic ideal that has
      been their dream. Assuredly humanity, as this great painter saw it, could
      not be beautiful; one asks one&rsquo;s self what maiden in her teens, a pretty
      face, would have done in the midst of these good, plain folk, stunted and
      elderly, with faces like wrinkled apples. A simple accessory most of the
      time, woman is for him merely a termagant or a blue-stocking who has
      turned the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the eternal feminine, for Daumier appears in neither of these forms
      he sees it in Madame Chaboulard or Madame Fribochon, the old snuff-taking,
      gossiping portress, in a nightcap and shuffling <i>savates</i>, relating
      or drinking in the wonderful and the intimate. One of his masterpieces
      represents three of these dames, lighted by a guttering candle, holding
      their heads together to discuss the fearful earthquake at Bordeaux, the
      consequence of the government&rsquo;s allowing the surface of the globe to be
      unduly dug out in California. The representation of confidential
      imbecility could not go further. When a man leaves out so much of life as
      Daumier&mdash;youth and beauty and the charm of woman and the loveliness
      of childhood and the manners of those social groups of whom it may most be
      said that they <i>have</i> manners&mdash;when he exhibits a deficiency on
      this scale it might seem that the question was not to be so easily
      disposed of as in the very non-apologetic words I have just quoted. All
      the same (and I confess it is singular), we may feel what Daumier omitted
      and yet not be in the least shocked by the claim of predominance made for
      him. It is impossible to spend a couple of hours over him without
      assenting to this claim, even though there may be a weariness in such a
      panorama of ugliness and an inevitable reaction from it. This anomaly, and
      the challenge to explain it which appears to proceed from him, render him,
      to my sense, remarkably interesting. The artist whose idiosyncrasies,
      whose limitations, if you will, make us question and wonder, in the light
      of his fame, has an element of fascination not attaching to conciliatory
      talents. If M. Eugene Montrosier may say of him without scandalizing us
      that such and such of his drawings belong to the very highest art, it is
      interesting (and Daumier profits by the interest) to put one&rsquo;s finger on
      the reason we are not scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this reason is that, on the whole he is so peculiarly serious.
      This may seem an odd ground of praise for a jocose draughtsman, and of
      course what I mean is that his comic force is serious&mdash;a very
      different thin from the absence of comedy. This essential sign of the
      caricaturist may surely be anything it will so long as it is there.
      Daumier&rsquo;s figures are almost always either foolish, fatuous politicians or
      frightened, mystified bourgeois; yet they help him to give us a strong
      sense of the nature of man. They are some times so serious that they are
      almost tragic the look of the particular pretension, combined with
      inanity, is carried almost to madness. There is a magnificent drawing of
      the series of &ldquo;Le Public du Salon,&rdquo; old classicists looking up, horrified
      and scandalized, at the new romantic work of 1830, in which the faces have
      an appalling gloom of mystification and platitude. We feel that Daumier
      reproduces admirably the particular life that he sees, because it is the
      very medium in which he moves. He has no wide horizon; the absolute
      bourgeois hems him in, and he is a bourgeois himself, without poetic
      ironies, to whom a big cracked mirror has been given. His thick, strong,
      manly touch stands, in every way, for so much knowledge. He used to make
      little images, in clay and in wax (many of them still exist), of the
      persons he was in the habit of representing, so that they might constantly
      seem to be &ldquo;sitting&rdquo; for him. The caricaturist of that day had not the
      help of the ubiquitous photograph. Daumier painted actively, as well, in
      his habitation, all dedicated to work, on the narrow island of St. Louis,
      where the Seine divides and where the monuments of old Paris stand thick,
      and the types that were to his purpose pressed close upon him. He had not
      far to go to encounter the worthy man, in the series of &ldquo;Les Papas,&rdquo; who
      is reading the evening paper at the café with so amiable and placid a
      credulity, while his unnatural little boy, opposite to him, finds
      sufficient entertainment in the much-satirized <i>Constitutionnel</i>. The
      bland absorption of the papa, the face of the man who believes everything
      he sees in the newspaper, is as near as Daumier often comes to positive
      gentleness of humor. Of the same family is the poor gentleman, in
      &ldquo;Actualités,&rdquo; seen, in profile, under a doorway where he has taken refuge
      from a torrent of rain, who looks down at his neat legs with a sort of
      speculative contrition and says. &ldquo;To think of my having just ordered two
      pairs of white trousers.&rdquo; The <i>tout petit bourgeois</i> palpitates in
      both these sketches.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must repeat that it is absurd to pick half a dozen at hazard, out of
      five thousand; yet a few selections are the only way to call attention to
      his strong drawing. This has a virtuosity of its own, for all its
      hit-or-miss appearance. Whatever he touches&mdash;the nude, in the
      swimming-baths on the Seine, the intimations of landscape, when his <i>petits
      rentiers</i> go into the suburbs for a Sunday&mdash;acquires relief and
      character, Docteur Véron, a celebrity of the reign of Louis-Philippe, a
      Mæcenas of the hour, a director of the opera, author of the <i>Mémoires
      d&rsquo;un Bourgeois de Paris</i>&mdash;this temporary &ldquo;illustration,&rdquo; who
      appears to have been almost indecently ugly, would not be vivid to us
      to-day had not Daumier, who was often effective at his expense, happened
      to have represented him, in some crisis of his career, as a sort of naked
      inconsolable Vitellius. He renders the human body with a cynical sense of
      its possible flabbiness and an intimate acquaintance with its structure.
      &ldquo;Une Promenade Conjugale,&rdquo; in the series of &ldquo;Tout ce qu&rsquo;on voudra,&rdquo;
       portrays a hillside, on a summer afternoon, on which a man has thrown
      himself on his back to rest, with his arms locked under his head. His fat,
      full-bosomed, middle-aged wife, under her parasol, with a bunch of
      field-flowers in her hand, looks down at him patiently and seems to say,
      &ldquo;Come, my dear, get up.&rdquo; There is surely no great point in this; the only
      point is life, the glimpse of the little snatch of poetry in prose. It is
      a matter of a few broad strokes of the crayon; yet the pleasant laziness
      of the man, the idleness of the day, the fragment of homely, familiar
      dialogue, the stretch of the field with a couple of trees merely
      suggested, have a communicative truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I perhaps exaggerate all this, and in insisting upon the merit of Daumier
      may appear to make light of the finer accomplishment of several more
      modern talents, in England and France, who have greater ingenuity and
      subtlety and have carried qualities of execution so, much further. In
      looking at this complicated younger work, which has profited so by
      experience and comparison, it is inevitable that we should perceive it to
      be infinitely more cunning. On the other hand Daumier, moving in his
      contracted circle, has an impressive depth. It comes back to his strange
      seriousness. He is a draughtsman by race, and if he has not extracted the
      same brilliancy from training, or perhaps even from effort and experiment,
      as some of his successors, does not his richer satiric and sympathetic
      feeling more than make up the difference?
    </p>
    <p>
      However this question may be answered, some of his drawings belong to the
      class of the unforgetable. It may be a perversity of prejudice, but even
      the little cut of the &ldquo;Connoisseurs,&rdquo; the group of gentlemen collected
      round a picture and criticising it in various attitudes of sapience and
      sufficiency, appears to me to have the strength that abides. The criminal
      in the dock, the flat-headed murderer, bending over to speak to his
      advocate, who turns a whiskered, professional, anxious head to caution and
      remind him. tells a large, terrible story and awakes a recurrent shudder.
      We see the gray court-room, we feel the personal suspense and the
      immensity of justice. The &ldquo;Saltimbanques,&rdquo; reproduced in <i>L&rsquo;Art</i> for
      1878, is a page of tragedy, the finest of a cruel series. M. Eugène
      Montrosier says of it that &ldquo;The drawing is masterly, incomparably firm,
      the composition superb, the general impression quite of the first order.&rdquo;
       It exhibits a pair of lean, hungry mountebanks, a clown and a harlequin
      beating the drum and trying a comic attitude to attract the crowd, at a
      fair, to a poor booth in front of which a painted canvas, offering to view
      a simpering fat woman, is suspended. But the crowd doesn&rsquo;t come, and the
      battered tumblers, with their furrowed cheeks, go through their pranks in
      the void. The whole thing is symbolic and full of grim-ness, imagination
      and pity. It is the sense that we shall find in him, mixed with his
      homelier extravagances, an element prolific in indications of this order
      that draws us back to Daumier.

    <h2>
      AFTER THE PLAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The play was not over when the curtain fell, four months ago; it was
      continued in a supplementary act or epilogue which took place immediately
      afterwards. &ldquo;Come home to tea,&rdquo; Florentia said to certain friends who had
      stopped to speak to her in the lobby of the little theatre in Soho&mdash;they
      had been present at a day performance by the company of the Theatre Libre,
      transferred for a week from Paris; and three of these&mdash;Auberon and
      Dorriforth, accompanying Amicia&mdash;turned up so expeditiously that the
      change of scene had the effect of being neatly executed. The short
      afterpiece&mdash;it was in truth very slight&mdash;began with Amicia&rsquo;s
      entrance and her declaration that she would never again go to an afternoon
      performance: it was such a horrid relapse into the real to find it staring
      at you through the ugly daylight on coming out of the blessed fictive
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Ah, you touch there on one of the minor sorrows of
      life. That&rsquo;s an illustration of the general change that comes to pass in
      us as we grow older, if we have ever loved the stage: the fading of the
      glamour and the mystery that surround it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Do you call it a minor sorrow? It&rsquo;s one of the greatest.
      And nothing can mitigate it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be mitigated a little if the stage were a
      trifle better? You must remember how that has changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Never, never: it&rsquo;s the same old stage. The change is in
      ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Well, I never would have given an evening to what we
      have just seen. If one could have put it in between luncheon and tea, well
      enough. But one&rsquo;s evenings are too precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Note that&mdash;it&rsquo;s very important.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I mean too precious for that sort of thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Then you didn&rsquo;t sit spellbound by the little history of
      the Due d&rsquo;Enghien?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I sat yawning. Heavens, what a piece!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Upon my word I liked it. The last act made me cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Wasn&rsquo;t it a curious, interesting specimen of some of
      the things that are worth trying: an attempt to sail closer to the real?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> How much closer? The fiftieth part of a point&mdash;it
      isn&rsquo;t calculable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> It was just like any other play&mdash;I saw no
      difference. It had neither a plot, nor a subject, nor dialogue, nor
      situations, nor scenery, nor costumes, nor acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Then it was hardly, as you say, just like any other play.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Florentia should have said like any other <i>bad</i>&rsquo;one.
      The only way it differed seemed to be that it was bad in theory as well as
      in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> It&rsquo;s a <i>morceau de vie</i>, as the French say.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Oh, don&rsquo;t begin on the French!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> It&rsquo;s a French experiment&mdash;<i>que voulez-vous?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> English experiments will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> No doubt they would&mdash;if there <i>were</i> any. But
      I don&rsquo;t see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Fortunately: think what some of them might be! Though
      Florentia saw nothing I saw many things in this poor little shabby &ldquo;Due
      d&rsquo;Enghien,&rdquo; coming over to our roaring London, where the dots have to be
      so big on the i&rsquo;s, with its barely audible note of originality. It
      appealed to me, touched me, offered me a poignant suggestion of the way
      things happen in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> In life they happen clumsily, stupidly, meanly. One goes
      to the theatre just for the refreshment of seeing them happen in another
      way&mdash;in symmetrical, satisfactory form, with unmistakable effect and
      just at the right moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> It shows how the same cause may produce the most
      diverse consequences. In this truth lies the only hope of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Oh, art, art&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk about art!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Mercy, we must talk about something!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Auberon hates generalizations. Nevertheless I make bold
      to say that we go to the theatre in the same spirit in which we read a
      novel, some of us to find one thing and some to find another; and
      according as we look for the particular thing we find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> That&rsquo;s a profound remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> We go to find amusement: that, surely, is what we all go
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> There&rsquo;s such a diversity in our idea of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Don&rsquo;t you impute to people more ideas than they have?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Ah, one must do that or one couldn&rsquo;t talk about them.
      We go to be interested; to be absorbed, beguiled and to lose ourselves, to
      give ourselves up, in short, to a charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> And the charm is the strange, the extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Ah, speak for yourself! The charm is the recognition of
      what we know, what we feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> See already how you differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What we surrender ourselves to is the touch of nature, the sense of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> The first thing is to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> The first thing, on the contrary, is to <i>dis</i>believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Lord, listen to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> The first thing is to folio&mdash;to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I read a novel, I go to the theatre, to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> To forget what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> To forget life; to thro myself into something more
      beautiful more exciting: into fable and romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> The attraction of fable and romance is that it&rsquo;s about
      <i>us</i>, about you and me&mdash;or people whose power to suffer and to
      enjoy is the same as ours. In other words, we <i>live</i> their
      experience, for the time, and that&rsquo;s hardly escaping from life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I&rsquo;m not at all particular as to what you call it. Call
      it an escape from the common, the prosaic, the immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> You couldn&rsquo;t put it better. That&rsquo;s the life that art,
      with Auberon&rsquo;s permission, gives us; that&rsquo;s the distinction it confers.
      This is why the greatest commonness is when our guide turns out a vulgar
      fellow&mdash;the angel, as we had supposed him, who has taken us by the
      hand. Then what becomes of our escape?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> It&rsquo;s precisely then that I complain of him. He leads us
      into foul and dreary places&mdash;into flat and foolish deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> He leads us into his own mind, his own vision of
      things: that&rsquo;s the only place into which the poet <i>can</i> lead us. It&rsquo;s
      there that he finds &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; it is there that he finds &ldquo;Comus,&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;The Way of the World,&rdquo; or the Christmas pantomime. It is when he
      betrays us, after he has got us in and locked the door, when he can&rsquo;t keep
      from us that we are in a bare little hole and that there are no pictures
      on the walls, it is then that the immediate and the foolish overwhelm us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> That&rsquo;s what I liked in the piece we have been looking at.
      There was an artistic intention, and the little room wasn&rsquo;t bare: there
      was sociable company in it. The actors were very humble aspirants, they
      were common&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Ah, when the French give their mind to that&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Nevertheless they struck me as recruits to an interesting
      cause, which as yet (the house was so empty) could confer neither money
      nor glory. They had the air, poor things, of working for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> For love of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Of the whole little enterprise&mdash;the idea of the
      Théâtre Libre.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Gracious, what you see in things! Don&rsquo;t you suppose they
      were paid?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> I know nothing about it. I liked their shabbiness&mdash;they
      had only what was indispensable in the way of dress and scenery. That
      often pleases me: the imagination, in certain cases, is more finely
      persuaded by the little than by the much.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I see what Amicia means.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I&rsquo;ll warrant you do, and a great deal more besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> When the appointments are meagre and sketchy the
      responsibility that rests upon the actors becomes a still more serious
      thing, and the spectator&rsquo;s observation of the way they rise to it a
      pleasure more intense. The face and the voice are more to the purpose than
      acres of painted canvas, and a touching intonation, a vivid gesture or
      two, than an army of supernumeraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Why not have everything&mdash;the face, the voice, the
      touching intonations, the vivid gestures, the acres of painted canvas, <i>and</i>
      the army of supernumeraries? Why not use bravely and intelligently every
      resource of which the stage disposes? What else was Richard Wagner&rsquo;s great
      theory, in producing his operas at Bayreuth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Why not, indeed? That would be the ideal. To have the
      picture complete at the same time the figures do their part in producing
      the particular illusion required&mdash;what a perfection and what a joy! I
      know no answer to that save the aggressive, objectionable fact. Simply
      look at the stage of to-day and observe that these two branches of the
      matter never do happen to go together. There is evidently a corrosive
      principle in the large command of machinery and decorations&mdash;a germ
      of perversion and corruption. It gets the upperhand&mdash;it becomes the
      master. It is so much less easy to get good actors than good scenery and
      to represent a situation by the delicacy of personal art than by &ldquo;building
      it in&rdquo; and having everything real. Surely there is no reality worth a
      farthing, on the stage, but what the actor gives, and only when he has
      learned his business up to the hilt need he concern himself with his
      material accessories. He hasn&rsquo;t a decent respect for his art unless he be
      ready to render his part as if the whole illusion depended on that alone
      and the accessories didn&rsquo;t exist. The acting is everything or it&rsquo;s
      nothing. It ceases to be everything as soon as something else becomes very
      important. This is the case, to-day, on the London stage: something else
      is very important. The public have been taught to consider it so: the
      clever machinery has ended by operating as a bribe and a blind. Their
      sense of the rest of the matter has gone to the dogs, as you may perceive
      when you hear a couple of occupants of the stalls talking, in a tone that
      excites your curiosity, about a performance that&rsquo;s &ldquo;splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Do you ever hear the occupants of the stalls talking?
      Never, in the <i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>, have I detected, on their lips, a
      criticism or a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Oh, they say &ldquo;splendid&rdquo;&mdash;distinctly! But a
      question or two reveals that their reference is vague: they don&rsquo;t
      themselves know whether they mean the art of the actor or that of the
      stage-carpenter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Isn&rsquo;t that confusion a high result of taste? Isn&rsquo;t it
      what&rsquo;s called a feeling for the <i>ensemble?</i> The artistic effect, as a
      whole, is so welded together that you can&rsquo;t pick out the parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Precisely; that&rsquo;s what it is in the best cases, and
      some examples are wonderfully clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Then what fault do you find? Dorriforth. Simply this&mdash;that
      the whole is a pictorial whole, not a dramatic one. There is something
      indeed that you can&rsquo;t pick out, for the very good reason that&mdash;in any
      serious sense of the word&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t there.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> The public has taste, then, if it recognizes and
      delights in a fine picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I never said it hadn&rsquo;t, so far as that goes. The public
      likes to be amused, and small blame to it. It isn&rsquo;t very particular about
      the means, but it has rather a preference for amusements that I believes
      to be &ldquo;improving,&rdquo; other things being equal. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s either
      very intelligent or at all opinionated, the dear old public it takes
      humbly enough what is given it and it doesn&rsquo;t cry for the moon. It has an
      idea that fine scenery is an appeal to its nobler part, and that it shows
      a nice critical sense in preferring it to poor. That&rsquo;s a real intellectual
      flight, for the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Very well, its preference is right, and why isn&rsquo;t that a
      perfectly legitimate state of things?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Why isn&rsquo;t it? It distinctly <i>is!</i> Good scenery and
      poor acting are better than poor scenery with the same sauce. Only it
      becomes then another matter: we are no longer talking about the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Very likely that&rsquo;s the future of the drama, in London&mdash;an
      immense elaboration of the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> My dear fellow, you take the words out of my mouth. An
      immense elaboration of the picture and an immense sacrifice of everything
      else: it would take very little more to persuade me that that will be the
      only formula for our children. It&rsquo;s all right, when once we have buried
      our dead. I have no doubt that the scenic part of the art, remarkable as
      some of its achievements already appear to us, is only in its infancy, and
      that we are destined to see wonders done that we now but faintly conceive.
      The probable extension of the mechanical arts is infinite. &ldquo;Built in,&rdquo;
       forsooth! We shall see castles and cities and mountains and rivers built
      in. Everything points that way; especially the constitution of the
      contemporary multitude. It is huge and good-natured and common. It likes
      big, unmistakable, knock-down effects; it likes to get its money back in
      palpable, computable change. It&rsquo;s in a tremendous hurry, squeezed
      together, with a sort of generalized gape, and the last thing it expects
      of you is that you will spin things fine. You can&rsquo;t portray a character,
      alas, or even, vividly, any sort of human figure, unless, in some degree,
      you do that. Therefore the theatre, inevitably accommodating itself, will
      be at last a landscape without figures. I mean, of course, without figures
      that count. There will be little illustrations of costume stuck about&mdash;dressed
      manikins; but they&rsquo;ll have nothing to say: they won&rsquo;t even go through the
      form of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> What a hideous prospect!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Not necessarily, for we shall have grown used to it: we
      shall, as I say, have buried our dead. To-day it&rsquo;s cruel, because our old
      ideals are only dying, they are <i>in extremis</i>, they are virtually
      defunct, but they are above-ground&mdash;we trip and stumble on them. We
      shall eventually lay them tidily away. This is a bad moment, because it&rsquo;s
      a moment of transition, and we still <i>miss</i> the old superstition, the
      bravery of execution, the eloquence of the lips, the interpretation of
      character. We miss these things, of course, in proportion as the
      ostensible occasion for them is great; we miss them particularly, for
      instance, when the curtain rises on Shakespeare. Then we are conscious of
      a certain divine dissatisfaction, of a yearning for that which isn&rsquo;t. But
      we shall have got over this discomfort on the day when we have accepted
      the ostensible occasion as merely and frankly ostensible, and the real one
      as having nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I don&rsquo;t follow you. As I&rsquo;m one of the squeezed, gaping
      public, I must be dense and vulgar. You do, by-the-way, immense injustice
      to that body. They do care for character&mdash;care much for it. Aren&rsquo;t
      they perpetually talking about the actor&rsquo;s conception of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Dear lady, what better proof can there be of their
      ineptitude, and that painted canvas and real water are the only things
      they understand? The vanity of wasting time over that!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Over what?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> The actor&rsquo;s conception of a part. It&rsquo;s the refuge of
      observers who are no observers and critics who are no critics. With what
      on earth have we to do save his execution?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I don&rsquo;t in the least agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Are you very sure, my poor Dorriforth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Give him rope and he&rsquo;ll hang himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> It doesn&rsquo;t need any great license to ask who in the
      world holds in his bosom the sacred secret of the right conception. All
      the actor can do is to give us his. We must take that one for granted, we
      make him a present of it. He must impose his conception upon us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon</b> (interrupting). I thought you said we accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Impose it upon our <i>attention</i>. clever Auberon. It
      is because we accept his idea that he must repay us by making it vivid, by
      showing us how valuable it is. We give him a watch: he must show us what
      time it keeps. He winds it up, that is he executes the conception, and his
      execution is what we criticise, if we be so moved. Can anything be more
      absurd than to hear people discussing the conception of a part of which
      the execution doesn&rsquo;t exist&mdash;the idea of a character which never
      arrives at form? Think what it is, that form, as an accomplished actor may
      give it to us, and admit that we have enough to do to hold him to this
      particular honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Do you mean to say you don&rsquo;t think some conceptions are
      better than some others?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Most assuredly, some are better: the proof of the
      pudding is in the eating. The best are those which yield the most points,
      which have the largest face; those, in other words, that are the most
      demonstrable, or, in other words still, the most actable. The most
      intelligent performer is he who recognizes most surely this &ldquo;actable&rdquo; and
      distinguishes in it the more from the less. But we are so far from being
      in possession of a subjective pattern to which we have a right to hold him
      that he is entitled directly to contradict any such absolute by presenting
      us with different versions of the same text, each completely colored,
      completely consistent with itself. Every actor in whom the artistic life
      is strong must often feel the challenge to do that. I should never think,
      for instance, of contesting an actress&rsquo;s right to represent Lady Macbeth
      as a charming, insinuating woman, if she really sees the figure that way.
      I may be surprised at such a vision; but so far from being scandalized, I
      am positively thankful for the extension of knowledge, of pleasure, that
      she is able to open to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> A reading, as they say, either commends itself to one&rsquo;s
      sense of truth or it doesn&rsquo;t. In the one case&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> In the one case I recognize&mdash;even&mdash;or
      especially&mdash;when the presumption may have been against the particular
      attempt, a consummate illustration of what art can do. In the other I
      moralize indulgently upon human rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> You have an assurance <i>à taute épreuve</i>; but you
      are deplorably superficial. There is a whole group of plays and a whole
      category of acting to which your generalizations quite fail to apply. Help
      me, Auberon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> You&rsquo;re easily exhausted. I suppose she means that it&rsquo;s far
      from true everywhere that the scenery is everything. It may be true&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t say it is!&mdash;of two or three good-natured playhouses in London.
      It isn&rsquo;t true&mdash;how can it be?&mdash;of the provincial theatres or of
      the others in the capital. Put it even that they would be all scenery if
      they could; they can&rsquo;t, poor things&mdash;so they have to provide acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> They have to, fortunately; but what do we hear of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> How do you mean, what do we hear of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> In what trumpet of fame does it reach us? They do what
      they can, the performers Auberon alludes to, and they are brave souls. But
      I am speaking of the conspicuous cases, of the exhibitions that draw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> There is good acting that draws; one could give you
      names and places.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I have already guessed those you mean. But when it
      isn&rsquo;t too much a matter of the paraphernalia it is too little a matter of
      the play. A play nowadays is a rare bird. I should like to see ¦ one. <b>Florentia.</b>
      There are lots of them, all the while&mdash;the newspapers talk about
      them. People talk about them at dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> What do they say about them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> The newspapers?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> No, I don&rsquo;t care for <i>them</i>. The people at
      dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Oh. they don&rsquo;t say anything in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Doesn&rsquo;t that seem to show the effort isn&rsquo;t very
      suggestive?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> The conversation at dinners certainly isn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I mean our contemporary drama. To begin with, you can&rsquo;t
      find it there&rsquo;s no text.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> No text?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> So much the better!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> So much the better if there is to be no criticism.
      There is only a dirt prompter&rsquo;s book. One can&rsquo;t put one&rsquo;s hand upon it;
      one doesn&rsquo;t know what one is discussing. There is no &ldquo;authority&rdquo;&mdash;nothing
      is ever published.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> The pieces wouldn&rsquo;t bear that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> It would be a small ordeal to resist&mdash;if there
      were anything in them. Look at the novels!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> The text is the French <i>brochure</i>. The &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; is
      unprintable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s so wrong, It ought at least to be as
      good as the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Aren&rsquo;t there some &ldquo;rights&rdquo; to protect&mdash;some risk of
      the play being stolen if it&rsquo;s published?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> There may be&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Doesn&rsquo;t that only
      prove how little important we regard the drama as being, and how little
      seriously we take it, if we won&rsquo;t even trouble ourselves to bring about
      decent civil conditions for its existence? What have we to do with the
      French <i>brochure?</i> how does that help us to represent our own life,
      our manners, our customs, our ideas, our English types, our English world?
      Such a field for comedy, for tragedy, for portraiture, for satire, as they
      all make-such subjects as they would yield! Think of London alone&mdash;what
      a matchless hunting-ground for the satirist&mdash;the most magnificent
      that ever was. If the occasion always produced the man London would have
      produced an Aristophanes. But somehow it doesn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Oh, types and ideas, Aristophanes and satire&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I&rsquo;m too ambitious, you mean? I shall presently show you
      that I&rsquo;m not ambitious at all. Everything makes against that&mdash;I am
      only reading the signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> The plays are arranged to be as English as possible: they
      are altered, they are fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Fitted? Indeed they are, and to the capacity of
      infants. They are in too many cases made vulgar, puerile, barbarous. They
      are neither fish nor flesh, and with all the point that&rsquo;s left out and all
      the naïveté that&rsquo;s put in, they cease to place before us any coherent
      appeal or any recognizable society.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> They often make good plays to act, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> They may; but they don&rsquo;t make good plays to see or to
      hear. The theatre consists of two things, <i>que diable</i>&mdash;of the
      stage and the drama, and I don&rsquo;t see how you can have it unless you have
      both, or how you can have either unless you have the other. They are the
      two blades of a pair of scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> You are very unfair to native talent. There are lots of <i>strictly
      original</i> plays&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> Yes, they put that expression on the posters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> I don&rsquo;t know what they put on the posters; but the plays
      are written and acted&mdash;produced with great success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Produced&mdash;partly. A play isn&rsquo;t fully produced
      until it is in a form in which you can refer to it. We have to talk in the
      air. I can refer to my Congreve, but I can&rsquo;t to my Pinero. {*}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Since the above was written several of Mr. Pinero&rsquo;s plays
       have been published.
</pre>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> The authors are not bound to publish them if they don&rsquo;t
      wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Certainly not, nor are they in that case bound to
      insist on one&rsquo;s not being a little vague about them. They are perfectly
      free to withhold them; they may have very good reasons for it, and I can
      imagine some that would be excellent and worthy of all respect. But their
      withholding them is one of the signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> What signs?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Those I just spoke of&mdash;those we are trying to read
      together. The signs that ambition and desire are folly, that the sun of
      the drama has set, that the matter isn&rsquo;t worth talking about, that it has
      ceased to be an interest for serious folk, and that everything&mdash;everything,
      I mean, that&rsquo;s anything&mdash;is over. The sooner we recognize it the
      sooner to sleep, the sooner we get clear of misleading illusions and are
      purged of the bad blood that disappointment makes. It&rsquo;s a pity, because
      the theatre&mdash;after every allowance is made&mdash;<i>might</i> have
      been a fine thing. At all events it was a pleasant&mdash;it was really
      almost a noble&mdash;dream. <i>Requiescat!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I see nothing to confirm your absurd theory. I delight
      in the play; more people than ever delight in it with me; more people than
      ever go to it, and there are ten theatres in London where there were two
      of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Which is what was to demonstrated. Whence do they
      derive their nutriment?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Why, from the enormous public.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> My dear fellow, I&rsquo;m not talking of the box-office. What
      wealth of dramatic, of histrionic production have we to meet that enormous
      demand? There will be twenty theatres ten years hence where there are ten
      to-day, and there will be, no doubt, ten times as many people &ldquo;delighting
      in them,&rdquo; like Florentla. But it won&rsquo;t alter the fact that our dream will
      have been dreamed. Florentia said a word when we came in which alone
      speaks volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> What was my word?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> You are sovereignly unjust to native talent among the
      actors&mdash;I leave the dramatists alone. There are many who do
      excellent, independent work; strive for perfection, completeness&mdash;in
      short, the things we want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I am not in the least unjust to them&mdash;I only pity
      them: they have so little to put <i>sous la dent</i>. It must seem to them
      at times that no one will work for them, that they are likely to starve
      for parts&mdash;forsaken of gods and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> If they work, then, in solitude and sadness, they have
      the more honor, and one should recognize more explicitly their great
      merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Admirably said. Their laudable effort is precisely the
      one little loop-hole that I see of escape from the general doom. Certainly
      we must try to enlarge it&mdash;that small aperture into the blue. We must
      fix our eyes on it and make much of it, exaggerate it, do anything with it
      tha may contribute to restore a working faith. Precious that must be to
      the sincere spirits on the stage who are conscious of all the other things&mdash;formidable
      things&mdash;that rise against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> What other things do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Why, for one thing, the grossness and brutality of
      London, with its scramble, its pressure, its hustle of engagements, of
      preoccupations, its long distances, its late hours, its nightly dinners,
      its innumerable demands on the attention, its general congregation of
      influences fatal to the isolation, to the punctuality, to the security, of
      the dear old playhouse spell. When Florentia said in her charming way&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> Here&rsquo;s my dreadful speech at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> When you said that you went to the Théâtre Libre in the
      afternoon because you couldn&rsquo;t spare an evening, I recognized the
      death-knell of the drama. <i>Time</i>, the very breath of its nostrils, is
      lacking. Wagner was clever to go to leisurely Bayreuth among the hills&mdash;the
      Bayreuth of spacious days, a paradise of &ldquo;development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Talk to a London audience of &ldquo;development!&rdquo; The long runs would, if
      necessary, put the whole question into a nutshell. Figure to yourself, for
      then the question is answered, how an intelligent actor must loathe them,
      and what a cruel negation he must find in them of the artistic life, the
      life of which the very essence is variety of practice, freshness of
      experiment, and to feel that one must do many things in turn to do any one
      of them completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> I don&rsquo;t in the least understand your <i>acharnement</i>,
      in view of the vagueness of your contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> My <i>acharnement</i> is your little joke, and my
      contention is a little lesson in philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> I prefer a lesson in taste. I had one the other night at
      the &ldquo;Merry Wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> If you come to that, so did I!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> So she does spare an evening sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> It was all extremely quiet and comfortable, and I don&rsquo;t
      in the least recognize Dorriforth&rsquo;s lurid picture of the dreadful
      conditions. There was no scenery&mdash;at least not too much; there was
      just enough, and it was very pretty, and it was in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> And what else was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> There was very good acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Amicia.</b> I also went, and I thought it all, for a sportive, wanton
      thing, quite painfully ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> Uglier than that ridiculous black room, with the invisible
      people groping about in it, of your precious &ldquo;Duc d&rsquo;Enghien?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> The black room is doubtless not the last word of art,
      but it struck me as a successful application of a happy idea. The
      contrivance was perfectly simple&mdash;a closer night effect than is
      usually attempted, with a few guttering candles, which threw high shadows
      over the bare walls, on the table of the court-martial. Out of the gloom
      came the voices and tones of the distinguishable figures, and it is
      perhaps a fancy of mine that it made them&mdash;given the situation, of
      course&mdash;more impressive and dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> You rail against scenery, but what could belong more to
      the order of things extraneous to what you perhaps a little priggishly
      call the delicacy of personal art than the arrangement you are speaking
      of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> I was talking of the abuse of scenery. I never said
      anything so idiotic as that the effect isn&rsquo;t helped by an appeal to the
      eye and an adumbration of the whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Auberon.</b> But where do you draw the line and fix the limit? What is
      the exact dose?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> It&rsquo;s a question of taste and tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> And did you find taste and tact in that coal-hole of the
      Théâtre Libre?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Coal-hole is again your joke. I found a strong
      impression in it&mdash;an impression of the hurried, extemporized
      cross-examination, by night, of an impatient and mystified prisoner, whose
      dreadful fate had been determined in advance, who was to be shot,
      high-handedly, in the dismal dawn. The arrangement didn&rsquo;t worry and
      distract me: it was simplifying, intensifying. It gave, what a judicious
      <i>mise-en-scène</i> should always do, the essence of the matter, and left
      the embroidery to the actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Florentia.</b> At the &ldquo;Merry Wives,&rdquo; where you could see your hand
      before your face, I could make out the embroidery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dorriforth.</b> Could you, under Falstaff&rsquo;s pasteboard cheeks and the
      sad disfigurement of his mates? There was no excess of scenery, Auberon
      says. Why, Falstaff&rsquo;s very person was nothing <i>but</i> scenery. A false
      face, a false figure, false hands, false legs&mdash;scarcely a square inch
      on which the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into
      illustrative touches. And he is so human, so expressive, of so rich a
      physiognomy. One would rather Mr. Beerbohm Tree should have played the
      part in his own clever, elegant slimness&mdash;-that would at least have
      represented life. A Falstaff all &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; is an opaque substance. This
      seems to me an example of what the rest still more suggested, that in
      dealing with a production like the &ldquo;Merry Wives&rdquo; really the main quality
      to put forward is discretion. You must resolve such a production, as a
      thing represented, into a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic
      pleasure in. Its grossness must be transposed, as it were, to a fictive
      scale, a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs. A filthy, eruptive,
      realistic Bardolph and Pistol overlay the romantic with the literal.
      Relegate them and blur them, to the eye; let their blotches be
      constructive and their raggedness relative.
    </p>
